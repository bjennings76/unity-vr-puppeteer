<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a lot of us right now you may be in a bit of a funk as the holidays are at their peak. There are family events, late nights, cold weather, warm beds and shopping. At least in the northern hemisphere it seems that everything is out to sabotage you getting to the gym or getting fit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, I’ve slacked off in my routine of three times a week due to family stress and frankly I don’t want to work out in a sub-freezing garage at 10 pm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So&#8230; what’s the solution. Nothing. Everything. I will say this: you have not failed. You will not fail just because you took a week, two, or three off.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time you get up and decide that you will get back on the bike, treadmill, continue pumping iron… you win. You win because you failed and still continued to better yourself. So put another quarter in the arcade, wrap up in a second layer and get some reps in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the stress from the holidays, you owe it to yourself to relieve some tension in some “me” time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come December 26th I’m gonna hit my home gym with a more challenging workout routine, I’m going to try to workout six times a week 3 cardio/strength and 3 skill or core based days.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43292" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Assassins-Creed-Movie-wallpaper-HD-film-2016-poster-image-e1482387207986.jpg" alt="assassins-creed-movie-wallpaper-hd-film-2016-poster-image" width="1024" height="576" /></p>
<p>As an avid gamer and cinephile, it frustrates me to no end when I think about all of the failed attempts at bringing good video games stories to the silver screen.  And when I say “good” I mean actually good, as in financially successful, critically acclaimed, and stays true to its source material.  Most of the video game movies that have been made barely achieve one of those marks let alone all three.  Take for example the <em>Resident Evil</em> series, what (sadly) is the leader of the video game movie pack in my humble opinion.  Those movies have consistently killed it financially compared to its fellow competitors but do they stay true to their source material?  No.  Are the performances or the stories any good? No.  On the other hand, you can take a movie like <em>Silent Hill</em> that was slavishly true to its source material BUT the acting and story were poor or like its sequel was a total box office failure.  And what do we find in between?  Movies that are completely forgettable or at best, unwillingly slide into the “so bad it’s good” zone.  Examples?  I thought you’d never ask…  How about <em>Tomb Raider</em> (one and two), <em>Doom, Prince of Persia, Street Fighter, Super Mario Brothers, MOOOOORTAAAL KOOOMBAAAAT,</em> and most recently <em>Hitman</em>, <em>Need for Speed,</em> and <em>Warcraft</em>.  Outside of one or two achieving a cult status years after their release almost none of those movies, in my opinion, do their respective properties or their audiences justice.  Enter <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em>.  With three big Hollywood names attached to it, a more than suitable Hollywood budget, and a game franchise that at its core has plenty of depth and room to explore.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43295" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/YwzcNux2FdPPiQqaeBomB4-e1482387473633.jpg" alt="ywzcnux2fdppiqqaebomb4" width="1024" height="576" /></p>
<p>The movie focuses on Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender) a convicted murderer on death row that is rescued from execution by a company known as the Abstergo Corporation.  Abstergo is a scientific research outfit that specializes in the exploration of the human genome.  Through the use of an Abstergo invention called the &#8220;Animus&#8221;, lead research scientist Sofia (Marion Cotillard) believes that within Lynch’s DNA lies a road map to a powerful ancient artifact called the &#8220;Apple of Eden&#8221;.  An artifact that Sofia and Abstergo&#8217;s founder (who also happens to also be her father), Rikkin (Jeremy Irons), are convinced has the ability to suppress the genetic properties in humans that lead to violent and aggressive behavior. Sofia explains to Lynch that the road map to the &#8220;Apple&#8221; doesn’t lie in his genetic code per se, but in the memories of his centuries dead ancestor named Aguilar, which Lynch’s DNA contains.  If that wasn’t enough to send Lynch’s head spinning, and Sofia also reveals to him that Aguilar was a member of a guild or &#8220;Brotherhood of Master Assassins&#8221; that have spent close to a thousand years resisting the global domination efforts of another secretive organization known as The Templars.  With the Apple of Eden in Templar hands, humanity could be easily subjected to a future of their making, under their totalitarian rule.  Both Sofia and Rikkin are Templars and hope that once Lynch is “attached” to the Animus he will be able to relive the Assassin mission centuries ago; which resulted in Aguilar taking possession of the Apple and in turn revealing its current day location to them.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43291" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/assassin-creed-5.jpg" alt="assassin-creed-5" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/assassin-creed-5.jpg 1000w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/assassin-creed-5-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/assassin-creed-5-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/assassin-creed-5-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/assassin-creed-5-620x414.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Right out of the gate, for anybody who’s played through an <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> game and thought it’d be awesome to see that style motion capture CGI come to life you came to the right place.  They nailed it.  I mean it’s all here, the sprinting, the climbing, the hand to hand close quarters combat.  You want death from above?  Check.  Crossbow and Gauntlet kills?  Check.  How about two handed multiple enemy deaths? Yes, sir!  Even my personal favorite, the super sneaky silent “oh shit, it’s too late brah your neck&#8217;s been broke” stealth kill?  Checkity check check!  You want the &#8220;Leap of Faith&#8221;?  Ehh, sort of… I mean, nobody’s perfect right?  Unfortunately, that’s where the enjoyment ends for <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed </em>and the schizophrenic mood, the convoluted Swiss cheese plotting, and stilted, uninspired acting take over.  For the purposes of keeping this review as brief as possible I won’t go into painstaking detail but instead, I’ll just say that outside of both the hand to hand combat and the Assassin vs. Templar concept, little else of the franchise mythology is given to you here.  I suspect that will be the job of future movies to do.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43293" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/landscape-1463060930-assassins-creed-movie-marion-cotillard-e1482387304767.jpg" alt="landscape-1463060930-assassins-creed-movie-marion-cotillard" width="1024" height="512" /></p>
<p>Michael Fassbender&#8217;s lead performance is good.  It’s intense, it’s physical, and it’s believable.  Unfortunately, the script gave him next to nothing to work with so when about halfway through the movie his character literally says on screen “What the FUCK is going on here??” I am right there with him, but I shouldn’t be.  The movie’s mood and pacing seemed to be at odds with each other as if one wanted to give me a gritty swords and sandals type action movie, while the other a contemplative, atmospheric thriller but instead the movie gives you a herky-jerky mishmash of both.  Two hours and twenty minutes of mishmash on top of that.  Cotillard and Irons are wasted here doing little else outside of whispering their lines with vacant expressionless stares, both to Fassbender and each other, and the secondary characters you are introduced to have no real reason to be there other than to help the main character and raise the body count at the very end of the movie.  And this movie’s ending is another entirely separate issue that detracts from its enjoyment.  I was thoroughly frustrated with the notion that this movie thought I would simply accept a neat little sequel primed bow on it when it clearly didn’t know what to do with its characters leading up to its climax.  Unearned twist endings and main characters doing an inexplicable hundred and eighty-degree motivation shift aren’t good storytelling.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43290" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/24269104-919766-e1482387541129.jpg" alt="24269104-919766" width="1024" height="512" /></p>
<p>But lastly good people, this brings me to what I feel like is the BIGGEST problem with this movie.  How in the hell do you make an <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> movie and it’s not rated R?  I don’t know about you but when I played my way through the last three titles (the only ones I&#8217;ve played) there was blood everywhere.  My character&#8217;s blood, enemies’ blood, innocent bystanders’ blood.  Is there any blood to be found in this movie?  Not by my definition.  Oh, it does try to sidestep that little dilemma by running the movie through a sepia like filter so that way if any bloodshed is caught on camera it shows as brown and not red, but that’s not acceptable. Cashing in on a giant of a video game franchise by making your movie accessible to as many paying customers as possible is a business decision.  And I get that, really I do but to make a movie about a video game that practically has MURDER in the title but not spill any blood or worse try to hand wave it away with camera tricks is in a word pathetic.   I readily hold up <em>Deadpool&#8217;s</em> surprising success earlier this year as clear proof that if you’ve got good characters and a good story people will take the blood and gore right along with it.  The <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> movie has neither.  Maybe they knew that when they saw the finished product and that’s why they did it.</p>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION: </strong></p>
<p>While the movie gives you the action the trailers promised, it delivers on nothing else.  This film is not worth your money or effort to see in theaters, maybe see this in a couple months on demand somewhere if you just have too.  Personally, I&#8217;d rather have my money back.</p>
<p><strong>RATING: 2 STARS (out of 5)</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN WATCH INSTEAD OF THIS:</strong></p>
<p>If you want brutal, blood-drenched <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed </em>style fighting action look no further than the 2011 modern martial arts spectacle known as <em>The Raid: Redemption</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing a game for the holidays should consider age and personality of the players, theme, and the amount of time between opening presents and the next meal. The holidays will likely include people who are new to gaming, so it is important to consider great gateway games. If you are not spending the holidays with hardcore gamers, not everyone will be concentrating solely on the game you are playing. So it might not be the best time to bring out a game that requires everyone’s attention at all times and has a large rule set (so it might not be the best time to try out </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twilight Imperium</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">…). Try to choose a game that people can chat over. If your family does enjoy games or are seasoned gamers, try to choose one that will incorporate everyone in the family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are some recommendations for games that can be played in different holiday settings.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ticket to Ride – Great fun with the kids</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-43266 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ticket-to-Ride-300x297.jpg" alt="ticket-to-ride" width="300" height="297" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ticket-to-Ride-300x297.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ticket-to-Ride-150x150.jpg 150w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ticket-to-Ride-75x75.jpg 75w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ticket-to-Ride-298x295.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ticket-to-Ride.jpg 562w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Number of Players: 2-5 players</strong><br />
<strong> Playing Time: 30-60 minutes</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ticket to Ride’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concept sounds boring when you describe it. But once you have convinced people to sit down and give it a go, the smooth mechanics of the game really bring it alive. In </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ticket to Ride</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, players build railways across continents as designated by Destination Cards. The longer the railway, the more points the players earn. </span><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-43272 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ticket-to-Ride-300x225.png" alt="ticket-to-ride" width="357" height="268" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ticket-to-Ride-300x225.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ticket-to-Ride-768x576.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ticket-to-Ride-298x224.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ticket-to-Ride-620x465.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ticket-to-Ride.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" /></p>
<p>The rules of the game are very easy to teach and learn, making it one of the best “gateway games” out there. However, don’t underestimate the simplicity of this game. The game’s mechanics challenges players to consider tactical maneuvers while balancing greed and practicality.  Not only is it a great game that is inclusive of all members of the family, but the game also does not require constant attention. Players can have casual conversations with onlookers or leave the table briefly to tend to the cooking. One downside is that cats (well my cats) love this game and LOVE batting around the trains. So don’t take your eyes away for too long!</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Codenames – For the large, social family</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><b><img class="size-medium wp-image-43262 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Codenames-213x300.png" alt="codenames" width="213" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Codenames-213x300.png 213w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Codenames-298x419.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Codenames-620x871.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Codenames.png 715w" sizes="(max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px" /></b></p>
<p><strong>Number of Players: 2-8+ players (no real limit, in my opinion)</strong><br />
<strong> Playing Time: 15-30 minutes</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Codenames</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, players are divided into two teams and are tasked with figuring out which “codenames” are associated with their team. Each group has a leader who gives their team clues about the codenames associated with their agents. It’s up to the team to figure out which agents are on their side without intercepting an agent on the opposing team, a civilian, or the assassin. These codenames include a word that is associated with tiles laid out on the table and a number which indicates the number of tiles that correspond with the given word. For example, “Cat 2” means that there are two tiles laid out on the table that are associated with the word cat. Then comes the hard part: the team leader must keep their mouth shut and not show any expression on their face while they listen to their teammates reason their way through the team leader’s logic. Oftentimes, everyone is wrong and everyone uses terrible judgment. But that’s why this game is so much fun! </span></p>
<p><strong><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vlaada Chvatil is a genius at board game design. He consistently introduces novel mechanics that are executed beautifully. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Codenames</span> </em><span style="font-weight: 400;">is probably the most played game in both my non-hardcore and super-hardcore gaming groups. If you have a family that is large and loves doing things together as a group, this is a fantastic game. There is no real limit to the number of people on a team, and the quick turnaround guarantees that many people can have a go at being the leader.  </span></p>

</ul>
<p><strong> <img class=" wp-image-43270 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gt-223x300.jpg" alt="gt" width="249" height="335" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gt-223x300.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gt-298x402.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gt.jpg 460w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Number of Players: 1-4</strong><br />
<strong> Playing Time: 60 minutes</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galaxy Trucker</span></em><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> players build a ship capable of carrying cargo and surviving the dangers of outer space. The game happens in two phases: the ship-building phase and the flying phase. During shipbuilding, players grab tiles from the middle of the table and piece together a space ship. It’s difficult because to build the best spaceship, you need the most of every component available; the rulebook even says so. But space to build is extremely limited, and not all of the tiles line up perfectly with each other. After the ship is built, you fly it through outer space. This is when you immediately regret all of your decisions. By flipping over event cards, players decide whether to take certain jobs, attempt to dodge from asteroids, and escape space pirates. Any of these events can cause a piece of your ship to be destroyed. If you didn’t design your ship well, this can lead to large chunks of your ship falling off. Losing pieces of your ship costs money, and sometimes you can lose your cargo and crew. The game consists of building progressively bigger ships and ends after three rounds. The winner with the most money at the end wins.  </span><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vlaada does it again! This game is fantastic, and I have actually played this with family at Christmas. It does require a bit more concentration than the previous two games described, but it’s worth it. Its unique mechanics are intuitive and easy to pick up. I would recommend playing one practice round first where everyone practices building a ship. I have found that my engineering friends are the best at this game…  </span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dead of Winter – For the hardcore board game family</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wp-image-43267 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dow-293x300.jpg" alt="dow" width="337" height="345" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dow-293x300.jpg 293w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dow-298x305.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dow.jpg 532w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /></p>
<p><strong>Number of Players: 2-5 players</strong><br />
<strong> Playing Time: 45 – 410 minutes</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some families are blessed with a multitude of wonderful board gamers. If that is the case, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dead of Winter</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a perfectly thematic game for the holidays. Though zombies have been a bit overdone in today’s pop culture, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dead of Winter</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does zombies right. The game is heart pounding and intelligently designed. Players take on the role of survivors of a zombie apocalypse and must work together towards a common goal. However, for a player to achieve victory, they must also attempt to accomplish a personal goal that is kept secret from the rest of the group. Sometimes these secret goals can be harmless, but there are a couple of options that can work against the common objective and maybe even cause the player to betray the group. This game is very story-centric and requires more attention than the games listed above. However, if your group for this holiday season enjoys a strong theme about surviving a harsh winter while also causing players to debate between the good of the group versus their own needs, this is a fantastic choice. What a perfect point of discussion during the holidays that stress caring for one another selflessly.  </span></p>

<p>Something is a brewin&#8217; in Glaine, the Jewel of the East and our good pal Lex is on the case.

<p>Our young heroes are in a somewhat awkward situation since they need to make sure they don&#8217;t look like nerds during the Harvest Festival. They need all of their fashion and maybe dates or maybe not, we are not here to judge a person for their solitary choices. But, regardless of the dates and the fashions that our adventurers may or may not have the Harvest Festival has become a test in its own right for our little group. Can they survive the next few days of hormonal awkwardness or will their shame lead them to a life of exile?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something very special happened to me while watching this episode of <em>Star Trek: The Animated Series</em>. I was watching with my stepson and, while they were contemplating their dilemma in this episode, he turned to me and said: “wow they try VERY hard to do the right thing”. It was incredibly touching. <em>Star Trek</em> has always been that to me: a shining beacon of what trying very hard to do the right thing looks like. The fact that it shined through as one of the main take away points of watching this show is a real testament to this iteration of <em>Star Trek</em>. Yes it&#8217;s the HOKIEST cartoon ever but the essence of Trek is here in spades.</p>
<p>Our action begins with a captain’s log. Turns out something is happening and…wait for it…the Enterprise is the ONLY ship in range?!? Can you believe that? What are the odds? Well, turns out pretty damn good so we better get used to this. The &#8216;we&#8217;re the only ship around&#8217; thing happens so much, I’m beginning to suspect it&#8217;s done on purpose as a running <em>Star Trek</em> writer’s room joke.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-43225 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Only-Ship-In-Range-300x182.png" alt="only-ship-in-range" width="878" height="532" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Only-Ship-In-Range-300x182.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Only-Ship-In-Range-768x465.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Only-Ship-In-Range-298x180.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Only-Ship-In-Range-620x375.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Only-Ship-In-Range.png 1135w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px" /></p>
<p>Turns out we are in frontier space; the furthest from Earth that humans dare live near a symbolically and humanitarian important colony which is being plagued by a cloud.</p>
<p>Yes. A cloud.</p>
<p>You’ve come with me on this journey this far so it’s time I level with you…there are a few things that <em>Star Trek</em> inexplicably loves to do and one of them is throw villainous clouds at us. Yes, I know you’re picturing the least threatening collection of atoms possible in your mental image of a cloud and…you’re not wrong. But it’s just a thing. Villainous clouds, which do all sorts of cloud villainy things including, in this case, munching on some sweet sweet colonists.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-43221 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cloud-300x224.png" alt="cloud" width="848" height="633" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cloud-300x224.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cloud-298x223.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cloud-620x464.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cloud.png 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /></p>
<p>Spock immediately sees a long game where he believes that if the cloud is eating planets like an amoeba eats food, there is no reason to believe these things can’t and won’t continue to eat indiscriminately. What a world!</p>
<p>We also are treated to one of my guilty nerdy Trek pleasures which is planetary politics and municipal governments. Wait. Please stay. I know I’ve told you this is a cheesy cartoon, that our only villain is a cloud, and that I am interested in the municipal government of this colony but there is beauty to be found in all this mess. Trust in me.</p>
<p>Oh and while we were talking the cloud straight up ate the Enterprise. Out of nowhere right? Surprised Kirk too.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-43222 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Eats-the-Enterprise-300x198.png" alt="eats-the-enterprise" width="839" height="554" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Eats-the-Enterprise-300x198.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Eats-the-Enterprise-768x507.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Eats-the-Enterprise-298x197.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Eats-the-Enterprise-620x409.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Eats-the-Enterprise.png 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px" /></p>
<p>Kirk ain’t gonna be no cloud food so he hits the guns. The Enterprise unloads its phasers on the cloud but it absorbs the energy. But throughout this excitement, Spock really knows what the people want and that’s more delicious cloud science. Turns out, this one sort of functions like a cell so the enterprise is actually suspended in this plasma liquid. Neat! Also, it is being digested with anti-matter that the cloud uses to break things down. Oh and apparently the Enterprise has this pulse super weapon thingy. Who knew?</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-43226 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Pulse-300x223.png" alt="pulse" width="845" height="628" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Pulse-300x223.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Pulse-768x571.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Pulse-298x221.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Pulse-620x461.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Pulse.png 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" /></p>
<p>Spock takes us full Magic School Bus and shares his theory that this is cloud is a living thing. The only thing keeping the Enterprise from being lunch is its quickly draining shields.</p>
<p>We have 3 hours and 20 minutes until the Cloud reaches the colony. The colony governor chooses to use that time to evacuate the children on the few ships the colony has. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f622.png" alt="&#x1f622;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Sulu maps out the cloud and did I mention we were going full Magic School Bus? Because with this map, we have reached peak Magic Bus.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-43224 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Magic-School-Bus-300x226.png" alt="magic-school-bus" width="878" height="662" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Magic-School-Bus-300x226.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Magic-School-Bus-768x579.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Magic-School-Bus-298x225.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Magic-School-Bus-620x468.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Magic-School-Bus.png 1054w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px" /></p>
<p>Kirk&#8217;s honest to Q plan is to give the cloud a tummy ache, which I kind of love. Kirk slams the ship right into the heart of the cloud, its shields pushing everything aside in what must be an uncomfortable process. McCoy decides to teach us about the human stomach.</p>
<p>Turns out, it&#8217;s a lot of work tromping through a giant tummy. The Enterprise is pooped and is dangerously low on anti-matter. Fortunately, this cloud uses anti-matter like digestive enzymes! So the Enterprise takes and eats some cloud guts to use as its new power source and is now part cloud.</p>
<p>Honestly you just had to be there. Oh and the set design for engineering is FANTASTIC in this episode.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-43223 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Energizer-300x220.png" alt="energizer" width="882" height="647" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Energizer-300x220.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Energizer-768x563.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Energizer-298x219.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Energizer-620x455.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Energizer.png 1069w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" /></p>
<p>While the Enterprise was eating cloud to feel better (!), Spock has found out that the cloud has a brain. I suppose we should now call it the Cloud. Kirk realizes that if it has a brain, it can be killed. And a moral dilemma ensues.</p>
<p>The Enterprise can now kill this cloud but it is becoming more and more obvious that this is a living thing. It is clear that killing the cloud will mean the destruction of the Enterprise.</p>
<p>We get an update from the planet and learn that only 5,000 children of the planet will be able to escape out of 82,000,000 people. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f622.png" alt="<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f622.png" alt="<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f622.png" alt="&#x1f622;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f622.png" alt="<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f622.png" alt="<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f622.png" alt="&#x1f622;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f622.png" alt="<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f622.png" alt="<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f622.png" alt="&#x1f622;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>As a last ditch effort, Spock decides to try to reach out with his Vulcan telepathic powers to the cloud.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-43227 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Telepathic-Spock-300x227.png" alt="telepathic-spock" width="838" height="634" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Telepathic-Spock-300x227.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Telepathic-Spock-768x582.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Telepathic-Spock-298x226.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Telepathic-Spock-620x470.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Telepathic-Spock.png 1059w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /></p>
<p>Spock: “Listen to me!”</p>
<p>Cloud: “New phone who dis?”</p>
<p>Spock: “I’m inside you rn.”</p>
<p>Cloud: “Wait. Say WHAT?!”</p>
<p>Spock: “yeah. And also pls no eat.”</p>
<p>Cloud:  “Oh. There are other things besides me that think and live and have the expectation of the dignity of life that I have experienced. It never occurred to me that my actions would inflict harm on another and the universe seems infinitely more alive and diverse with this paradigm altering knowledge. You know what?! I think with this new knowledge I am and will forever now be a vegetarian.”</p>
<p>That’s basically how it went down. Hey guess what reader? You are IN IT NOW. You just heard a Star Trek tale where the only bad guy was a cloud and where just briefly talking to a baddie and saying: “yo how about like no tho” fixed it all. You may be thinking this show sounds cheesy as heck (and you aren’t wrong about that) but trust me, it’s still a ton of fun. And having your kid look at you and say: &#8220;They try really hard to do the right thing in Star Trek&#8221; is something powerful to experience. Star Trek is about being the best that you can be and sometimes when there are killer clouds being the best, it means tickling its tummy and telling the cloud that the universe isn&#8217;t such a bad place after all.</p>
<p>If you are interested in experiencing more Trek with me I have begun a Star Trek Fate RP podcast. We are called <em>Highly Illogical</em>. Check us out sometime! Thanks for reading. Live long and prosper.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Coventry. A town located somewhere between over there and around about here. A town full of people, places and stories. Depending on who you talk to New Coventry was built on everything from fertile farming land to an ancient burial ground and was founded by pious pilgrims or lizard-headed demons. Whatever the case, New Coventry has had its share of good times and bad and it sure has a lot of stories to go around.</p>
<p>The Living Campaign series aims to bring those stories, good and bad, to the fore. Each article will explore a new place, or a new person, or some new event that’s taken place in New Coventry. It may be something good, something not so good or just something that the good folks of New Coventry just don’t like talking about.</p>
<p>The setting is rules agnostic, so feel free to pick and choose whatever you like, but the general feel is 1920’s small town; don’t expect too many dragons (maybe). If you’re running short on inspiration, every so often the Living Campaign will talk about how to use its various bits and pieces.</p>
<p>So with that, welcome to New Coventry stranger.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-42625 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nc.png" alt="Blackvittle Meatworks" width="624" height="448" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nc.png 624w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nc-300x215.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nc-298x214.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nc-620x445.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Blackvittle Meatworks</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blackvittle Meatworks is a massive vaulted brick building that towers above the New Coventry Warehouse District, just off the docks. Owned and operated by the wealthy Myron Blackvittle, it serves as the primary meat processing and distribution facility in the county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Meatworks is a place where the harvest of both the land and sea collide; lobster, tuna, and squid are processed in the same building as cattle, swine, and fowl. Something about this rather unconventional mixture of meats creates a lingering stench much worse than either the rotting brine or the rancid fat would alone. This reek&#8211;along with a series of rather perplexing industrial accidents&#8211;has given the Meatworks something of a dark reputation. Most citizens of New Coventry avoid the packing house, unless important business forces them there.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-42626 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nc2.png" alt="Blackvittle Meatworks Interior" width="550" height="364" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nc2.png 550w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nc2-300x199.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nc2-298x197.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inside of the Meatworks is a surprisingly labyrinthine collection of rooms with a wide variety of functions. The main floor is reserved for animal storage and slaughter, but the upper floors hold a tangled nest of workspaces set up for butchery and rendering. All manner of rusty and worn cleavers, hooks, and saws line the walls of the dark processing stations. The basement is taken up by a massive refrigeration unit, which is filled with hanging carcasses and whatever meats are ready for distribution and sale. Despite a concerted effort by the management to reduce the amount of viscera coating the walls and floors, the Meatworks is not a place for the weak-of-stomach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the Blackvittle Meatworks is supposed to only be operational during the day, sometimes the screams and squeals of slaughter are heard late into the night. No one would dare question the operations of such an important part of New Coventry’s industry, but it is occasionally observed that some of the meat that comes out of the packing house has a bit of an… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">unconventional</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taste.</span></p>

<p>Be forewarned my friends, this album is not going to be for everyone. In fact, it&#8217;s really not for any of us. This album is for his newborn child and the woman he loves. This album is a throwback to black music of the 60s and 70s. This album is a funkified force of nature. This album is for him. This album is Childish Gambino’s “<em>Awaken, My Love!</em>”.</p>
<p>“<em>Awaken, My Love!</em>” is the third studio album from artist Childish Gambino, also known as writer and actor Donald Glover. After a home run first season of his show <em>Atlanta </em>on FX, which Glover wrote, produced, and starred in, comes the last thing anyone expected from the quirky rapper: a completely sung P-Funk album. “<em>Awaken, My Love!</em>” is heavily influenced by funk legends Parliament-Funkadelic, Sly and the Family Stone, and The Isley Brothers. In an interview with Billboard, Glover described how these groups influenced him and his vision for the new album. “I remember hearing a Funkadelic scream and being like, ‘Wow, that’s sexual and it’s scary.’ Not having a name for that, though; just having a feeling. That’s what made it great.”</p>
<p>The album begins and immediately takes you on a roller-coaster of sound with the stellar first single, “Me and Your Mama”. Filled with raw wails and primal screams alongside a gospel choir, right off that bat you know that this is no ordinary Childish Gambino record. Glover’s voice and style of singing changes from song to song, emulating George Clinton to Prince. There is sporadic use of auto-tune throughout the album but not enough to beat the listener to death with. It’s used stylistically rather than a crutch in songs like “Boogieman”, “Zombies”, and the bubbly “California”. “The Night Me and Your Mama Met” has no lyrics but the choir returns over a scratch-guitar instrumental that features an amazing guitar solo reminiscent of Funkadelic’s “Maggot Brain”. The album concludes with clean and inspiring vocals from Glover on “Stand Tall”, urging the listener to “keep all your dreams, keep standing tall” and to “smile when you can”.</p>
<p>Personal Thoughts:</p>
<p>I thought the album was flat out amazing. I cannot get enough of it. I’m a huge fan of Donald Glover and all his projects. I attended Pharos this past Summer where he debuted the album in its entirety and also debuted the first three episodes of <em>Atlanta </em>before its televised release. A couple tracks did sound reworked compared to their live counterparts but I enjoyed “<em>Awaken, My Love!</em>” immensely. The more I listen to it, the more I interpret the album as a collection of stories and lessons from Glover’s own life that he is passing down to his newly born child. The album feels incredibly personal and really does not feel like it is meant for the listener but they too can learn from lessons that Glover has to give. Standout tracks include “<a href="https://youtu.be/_hZCsgcKa-g&quot;">Me and Your Mama</a>”, “Zombies”, “ Redbone”, and “Stand Tall”.</p>

We huddle around the microwaves a little too early during lunch, eyes wide with childish wonder, giddy over X-Wings, Alderaan, and the Death Star. Every few minutes we hush ourselves after realizing our voices have gotten a tad too loud.</p>
<p>Nika Howard and I had more questions for Dr. Karen Yu, who answered a few of our questions <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/geeklies-look-at-star-wars-1/">last time</a>. This time we go into how humans would cope in a Star Wars universe and how strong an AT-AT&#8217;s stomp is!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Alan</strong><strong>:</strong> What do you think it would be like to run underneath AT-ATs? Would you be able to considering the force of impact those legs would have?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yu:</strong> Let&#8217;s assume that the AT-AT has the same density of an M1 Abrams tank of about 0.76 tons/m<sup>3</sup>. I can&#8217;t say if they are using lightweight materials, or if they&#8217;re reactor is extra heavy, so this is a guess. If we draw a rectangular box around the AT-AT minus the head and just divide by 2 for the empty space between the legs, we get that it has a mass of about 400 tons. I believe the technical manuals say it can carry up to 1 ton of troops and other stuff, and it looks pretty loaded up, so we get a total mass of 401 tons. Now I have to say here that this mass is a COMPLETE guess, as a quick search from online reveals masses from 200 tons to over 2000 tons and nothing from any official sources.</p>
<p>Looking at the trailer, the leg moves about 1 m, and it takes about half a second, giving us 2 m/s. Now we plug it into Fd=<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>*mv<sup>2</sup>, where we assume that it makes a 0.1 m indent in the ground (a guess looking at pictures of AT-AT footprints on the internet) and divide by 4. Assuming that only <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of the mass is making the impact, we get around 4 MN, which is about twice the thrust of the main shuttle engine at lift off. If we look at the energy, we have about 200 kJ which is less than a 1.0 on the Richter scale, so fairly insignificant for the Earth. It is, however, similar to the energy released from 2 hand grenades, which I think is probably enough to knock all but the most sure-footed people on their bum.</p>
<p>Now, there are quite a lot of assumptions made here, including how much distance is traveled before the leg stops, the mass of the AT-AT, whether or not it uses a system where the centre of mass is shifted to the other 3 legs while this one is in motion, the type of ground it&#8217;s stepping on (marsh, concrete, etc.), and so on! So please do take this calculation as an imprecise estimate!</p>
<p><strong>Nika:</strong> What consequences would the modes of travel used in Star Wars have on the human body and how would the human body have to adapt to survive in the Star Wars universe?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yu:</strong> If I recall from the expanded universe books, the ships in Star Wars have access to what they call inertial dampeners which help mitigate the effects of high acceleration. If that&#8217;s the case, flying an X-wing or TIE fighter could potentially be less stress on the body than flying an F-22 is today. I believe the books also mention artificial gravity, which makes sense looking at how easily everyone walks around on the Falcon even when it&#8217;s not moving in space. Given this, space travel in Star Wars is most likely a very comfortable experience due to the technology they have, and potentially wouldn&#8217;t feel like they are moving at all (might cause motion sickness if you look out the window!).</p>
<p>As an example of what space travel might be like without the luxurious technologies of the Star Wars universe, we can look at The Expanse, whose travelers aren&#8217;t lucky enough to have inertial dampeners and artificial gravity. Given high enough acceleration, your heart can&#8217;t effectively pump blood to your brain, which is why people pass out in high G maneuvers. With a high enough sustained acceleration, this could easily kill someone. In The Expanse, a fluid is pumped into their bodies to counteract this effect. I&#8217;m not a biologist, but I can certainly see requiring something like this to ensure that we can handle the high accelerations needed to make space travel shorter time-wise. As for gravity, without the ability to generate this artificially, you&#8217;d need to use acceleration and centripetal force to simulate the effects. Now in many cases, this will mean you cannot get the gravity as high as we have on Earth. So you have people growing up in these environments with abnormally long limbs and bodies who aren&#8217;t able to stand on their own feet when they enter a real gravity well. This is, of course, pure conjecture, but quite possible for a person who lived their entire life in a low G environment. At present, muscle atrophy is a serious issue for our astronauts on the ISS. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/245.html">Here&#8217;s a recent report from NASA</a> talking about how current measures of exercise that the astronauts do aren&#8217;t enough to prevent injury upon their return.</p>
<p>Star Wars also has shields, which is great, because once we&#8217;re out of our atmosphere, we are exposed to quite a lot of solar radiation. In fact, airplane pilots and stewards/stewardesses are radiation workers because they are constantly exposed to more solar radiation simply because they&#8217;re in the air and have less atmosphere for the radiation to attenuate through. Similarly, the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field deflects a lot of the energetic cosmic rays, which wouldn&#8217;t happen if you&#8217;re far out from a plant. Without shielding you are likely to see higher incidences of cancer and other diseases caused by radiation among those conducting long term space travel. <a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY16/IG-16-003.pdf">Here&#8217;s another report from NASA</a> talking about this for any potential manned Mars missions.</p>
<hr />
<p>That&#8217;s all from Dr. Karen Yu.  You can see her talk a bit more about Star Wars <a href="http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/news/novel-thoughts-karen-yu-george-lucas-star-wars">here</a>.  Thanks for all your help, Dr. Yu!  You&#8217;ve given us some fantastic insight.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em> hits theaters Thursday, December 15th. We&#8217;re itching with anticipation like kids on Christmas Eve. For the first time, the story of how the Rebel Alliance infiltrated the Death Star will be revealed.</p>
<p>The trailers don&#8217;t tell us much. Dramatic music, another bad-ass female lead, and action scenes enough to make Tom Cruise salivate.</p>
<p>Our enthusiasm spurred a hunt for answers &#8211; answers to the science behind Star Wars.</p>
<p>Dr. Karen Yu is a tech consultant and expert in the use of photonic engineering for precision manufacturing. We asked Dr. Yu a couple questions about the science behind Star Wars that she was happy to answer. She&#8217;s a Star Wars fan and talks about the movies <a href="http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/news/novel-thoughts-karen-yu-george-lucas-star-wars">here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Nika</strong><strong>:</strong> What aspects of the Star Wars universe are scientifically possible and which absolutely aren&#8217;t?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yu:</strong> The Death Star would be possible. Given enough energy/power in a laser beam, it could potentially penetrate a planet and destroy the core. It would also take quite a lot of resources to build, which (theoretically) the Empire would have in abundance.</p>
<p>A lightsaber could be doable. I prefer to think of it as plasma held by a magnetic field, which would more easily explain why they don&#8217;t pass through one another and why it has a fixed end. If you really wanted to do it with light, you could potentially have a thin rod that extends in the middle that you don&#8217;t see, creating a partial reflector on the other similar to what you have in a laser cavity. The end then has a tight focus, so it looks like a tip, but really all the lights diverged and no longer has a high enough intensity to ionize the air, which would be how we see it. We have lasers presently that are powerful enough when focused to ionize and breakdown air, but unfortunately they are large and require a wall plug, so it will be a while before it&#8217;s ready to go mobile.</p>
<p>I hesitate to say that anything is absolutely impossible. Take the recent work on the EM-drive for example. As we understand things at present, it shouldn&#8217;t work but <a href="http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/1.B36120">a recent peer reviewed paper from NASA</a> shows that it does, and they&#8217;re not 100% sure why. Now it might still fail after testing in space, but I think it&#8217;s a great example of why you shouldn&#8217;t say anything is impossible.</p>
<p>Now, I could talk about &#8216;The Force&#8217;, but I think after the Episode I Midichlorians fiasco (seriously, why?), I feel people would prefer that remain a mystery!</p>
<p>HOWEVER, space dogfighting (as much as I enjoy watching them) is unlikely to happen as is shown in the films. I believe George Lucas based the original on plane combat in WWII movies and shows &#8211; thing is, there isn&#8217;t friction in space. A ship traveling at some speed is going to keep going at that speed until it hits something. They&#8217;re not going to stop just because the thrusters are off. All that will do is stop them from accelerating. Babylon 5 and BSG are much better for showing what it actually might be like, where you see thrusters firing in opposite directions to the motion of the ship when it&#8217;s stopping or when a fighter spins around to shoot behind them, but is still travelling in the original direction because they haven&#8217;t applied a thrust to stop that. But hey, who knows what technology will come along and change all that?</p>
<p><strong>Alan:</strong> What kind of/amount of energy would it take to pilot X-Wings in a Death Star valley with the kind of maneuvers they pulled in Episode 4, firing blasters all the while?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yu:</strong> They really don&#8217;t like to give masses for things, so let&#8217;s assume the X-Wing is the same as the maximum take-off mass of an F-22, 38000kg. It&#8217;s hard to tell how fast it&#8217;s going, but let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s at maximum atmospheric speed of 1050 km/h or 292 m/s (there&#8217;s probably not an atmosphere around the death star, but it&#8217;s all we got). For reference, that&#8217;s actually less than half the speed of an F-22, which can go at Mach 2, about 680 m/s. To (take a very simplistic) look at the work/energy done for the turn and assuming we maintain the same speed, we use (mv<sup>2</sup> /R)*θR, where R is the radius of the turn and θ is the angle. So, the radius cancels out and doesn&#8217;t really matter, just the angle of the turn, which in this case is 90 degrees. This makes sense! It tells us that it takes the same energy to make that turn no matter how sharp or wide; but depending on how long it takes us to do it, we&#8217;re going to need more POWER to accomplish it. So the energy requirement comes out to 5 GJ, and if the turn takes 2 seconds to complete, we need to be generating 2.5 GW of power. This is ignoring the constant downward thrust needed as the Death Star is likely providing a gravitational pull.</p>
<p>As for the blasters, that&#8217;s a bit trickier. Current lasers on the navy ships for shooting down drones go up to about 30 kW. For the blasters it&#8217;s probably significantly stronger than that. Let&#8217;s say 100 times that for all four, 3GW total. Now, I think you choose to fire 1, 2, or all 4 at once, so if we assume 2 of the blasters are going off at once during this high speed turn, we get 4 GW of power needed to do everything. The Bruce Nuclear Power Generating Station in Ontario, Canada is rated at 6.2 GW, so that&#8217;s the kind of power we&#8217;re talking about here!</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s possible that X-wings have pretty good batteries that the reactors charge into when it&#8217;s not going full tilt, so it might not have to generate quite that much power all the time!</p>

<p>Maybe that fight was just the distraction we needed since&#8230;well these emotions are almost too much to deal with right now.

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;Be smart. Be obedient. That might keep you alive&#8230; but nothing will keep you whole. Not in that place.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Set in a world of humans, beast-folk known as “Ancients”, Ancient/human half-breeds known as “Arcanics”, vagabond, storytelling cats, and Lovecraftian monstrosities known only as &#8220;The Old Gods&#8221;, <i>Monstress</i> is a high-fantasy story that has garnered a lot of attention within the last year. By exploring difficult themes such as racism, war, and fending off one&#8217;s inner demons (both metaphorically and literally), coupled with the talents of critically acclaimed writer Marjorie Liu and veteran comic artist Sana Takeda, it isn&#8217;t any surprise that this story ended up being a 2016 Eisner Award nominee for Best New Series? Today we&#8217;re going to attempt to analyze it and ultimately answer the question: Should You Read <i>Monstress</i>?</p>
<p>The events of <i>Monstress</i> follow Maika Halfwolf, a young survivor of a cataclysmic war between humans and the Arcanics and host to a dark force that is beyond her understanding. Having lost all memory of her childhood, Maika traverses her violent and divided world with reckless, heart wrenching desperation in an attempt to uncover the secrets of her past, resolve the murky mystery around her mother’s death, and understand the monster laying dormant inside of her.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42356" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/monstress-2.jpg" alt="monstress-2" width="1100" height="464" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/monstress-2.jpg 1100w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/monstress-2-300x127.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/monstress-2-768x324.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/monstress-2-298x126.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/monstress-2-620x262.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" /></p>
<p>Readers are immediately thrust into the action as they watch Maika, along with several other Arcanic children, be paraded in front of a group of aristocrats at a slave auction. It is here that readers see the true depravity of the Federation of Man; due to their half-man/half-beast heritage, the Arcanics are abhorred by humans and considered abominations to be sold to the highest bidder. In Maika&#8217;s case, the highest bidder happens to a member of the Cumaea: an order of humans with witch-like powers who perform sadistic experiments on Arcanics in an effort to strengthen their own powers. While this unfortunate turn of events actually plays right into Maika&#8217;s plans, the dire risks associated with her actions are made very apparent to the reader in excruciating detail. After enacting her foolhardy scheme, Maika&#8217;s secret becomes apparent to the Cumaea and she becomes caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse that threatens to destroy everything.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-42298 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1531739930823970477.png" alt="1531739930823970477" width="697" height="346" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1531739930823970477.png 697w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1531739930823970477-300x149.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1531739930823970477-298x148.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1531739930823970477-620x308.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /></p>
<p>Ultimately, <em>Monstress</em> excels in its storytelling. Liu&#8217;s narrative is paced in such a way that many of the more intricate details regarding the history and mechanics of the world are not immediately explained to the reader. Rather than having characters deliver expository monologues to explain their motivations or why things are the way they are, the story periodically delivers brief, single page historical lectures (in the form of an elder cat, Professor Tam Tam, telling stories to his kittens) between chapters to provide context to many of the background details of the universe. The end result is a confident, exciting narrative that is constantly progressing forward without getting caught up in the details.</p>
<p>The strong storytelling is further bolstered by Takeda&#8217;s stunning artwork, which is stylized to be a blend between Western comics and manga. Every page has an enormous amount of detail poured into it that makes the world come to life before the reader&#8217;s eyes; furthermore, the body language and expressions of the characters are so well done that they tell just as much of a story as the words on the page.</p>
<p>So, the question is: Should You Read <em>Monstress</em>? If you are looking for a story with a quick payoff that resolves its loose ends in a reasonable amount of time, it&#8217;s safe to assume that <em>Monstress</em> isn&#8217;t for you. While the series is only eight issues into its run, it is very clear that this is a complex story requiring plenty of time to tell. However, if you are willing to stick it out for the long haul, <em>Monstress</em> promises an expansive world of fantasy, mystery, monsters, and cats, that dares to rival even the most accomplished fantasy authors. Unleash your inner monster and give this one a read.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Coventry. A town located somewhere between over there and around about here. A town full of people, places and stories. Depending on who you talk to New Coventry was built on everything from fertile farming land to an ancient burial ground and was founded by pious pilgrims or lizard-headed demons. Whatever the case, New Coventry has had its share of good times and bad and it sure has a lot of stories to go around.</p>
<p>The Living Campaign series aims to bring those stories, good and bad, to the fore. Each article will explore a new place, or a new person, or some new event that’s taken place in New Coventry. It may be something good, something not so good or just something that the good folks of New Coventry just don’t like talking about.</p>
<p>The setting is rules agnostic, so feel free to pick and choose whatever you like, but the general feel is 1920’s small town; don’t expect too many dragons (maybe). If you’re running short on inspiration, every so often the Living Campaign will talk about how to use its various bits and pieces.</p>
<p>So with that, welcome to New Coventry stranger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Living Campaign: Campaign Adventures</u></strong></p>
<p>This week, we won’t be delving into the town of New Coventry and looking at a new, exciting place to explore. Rather, we’ll take a step back and look at how you might integrate the living campaign setting into your own game. We’ll give be giving you a handful of adventure hooks for each piece published so far. Some will be relatively low-risk, while others might threaten the whole town!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42088" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tenantless_farm_Texas_panhandle_1938.jpg" alt="tenantless_farm_texas_panhandle_1938" width="663" height="478" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tenantless_farm_Texas_panhandle_1938.jpg 663w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tenantless_farm_Texas_panhandle_1938-300x216.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tenantless_farm_Texas_panhandle_1938-298x215.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tenantless_farm_Texas_panhandle_1938-620x447.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Salt Lick Farm</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Low Risk</em></p>
<p>Animals flock to Salt Lick Farm, this is genuine bonafide New Coventry fact. Lately however, it looks like less and less of them have been flocking to the farm. And what few do seem to be dying in the night. No sign of blood or anything, just a patch of land getting stacked higher and higher with bodies. Yippee.</p>
<p><em>Medium Risk</em></p>
<p>Every so often Officer Delaney has to head on over to Salt Lick Farm to clear out any vagrants who might have taken up residence in the abandoned buildings on the land. An easy, but annoying job that cause Officer Delany no end of grumbling. This time however he seems to have come back with barely a furrowed brow on his face. In fact Officer Delany seems to not being doing much of anything since he last went to Salt Lick Farm, other than running off into the woods in the middle of the night. I’m sure it’s nothing.</p>
<p><em>High Risk</em></p>
<p>Crthnik-Dul, The Goat Headed has woken. A horrific amalgamation of animals, he now prowls in the caves beneath Salt Lick Farm and calls through the night to the animals around New Coventry. There is no doubt that should he manage to attain full power, his terrifying, bloody form would tear Salt Lick Farm asunder; followed by New Coventry.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42089" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/boat-shed-433345_960_720.jpg" alt="boat-shed-433345_960_720" width="667" height="456" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/boat-shed-433345_960_720.jpg 667w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/boat-shed-433345_960_720-300x205.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/boat-shed-433345_960_720-298x204.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/boat-shed-433345_960_720-620x424.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>McGregor’s Boat Shed</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Low Risk</em></p>
<p>The Lake Coventry Summer Race Bonanza is a highlight in the mid-year calendar as boats of all kinds take to the lake to thrash it out for the grand prize. A year of free pie at Johnson’s Eatery. Samuel Granwhiche’s boat, this year at least, is the clear front runner, having already demolished the first two rounds. Maybe his success has something to do with the ‘tune up’ he gives his boat after every round in McGregor’s boat shed?</p>
<p><em>Medium Risk</em></p>
<p>The past always comes back to haunt you. At least that’s what they say. With a little wooden dingy roaming the lake complete with headless wife and child, it would seem that phrase can sometimes be literal. New Coventry normally wouldn’t worry about a good haunting, but when its accompanied by a spate of drownings, now that’s a different story.</p>
<p><em>High Risk</em></p>
<p><em>Excerpt of Interview with James Pateman on Coventry Shortwave:</em></p>
<p>“Now, I can’t rightly claim to know what those boys is doing up there, but it can be good y’hear me? I told em’, told em’ right then and there. Don’t go messing with that shed I says. And they don’t listen and they just goes knocking it down anyway. Digging up all that old dirt, all them critters, all that blood. It aint right, puttin’ that all out in the air. Now them boys, well, lets just say that death’d be kinder.”</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42090" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7bf7bd17f50081de79b5d1177a73035d.jpg" alt="7bf7bd17f50081de79b5d1177a73035d" width="594" height="466" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7bf7bd17f50081de79b5d1177a73035d.jpg 594w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7bf7bd17f50081de79b5d1177a73035d-300x235.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7bf7bd17f50081de79b5d1177a73035d-298x234.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Mr. Mackerton’s Magical Menagerie</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Low Risk</em></p>
<p>Not everything on the shelves at Mr. Mackerton’s is 100% safe. This is especially true of some of the items that he keeps in the store’s cabinets. Perhaps one of your players shouldn’t have picked up the body swapping amulet?</p>
<p><em>Medium Risk</em></p>
<p>Economically, Mr. Mackerton doesn’t have any real competition. Magical menageries are hardly a dime a dozen in New Coventry. He does however have competition of a very different kind. The Travelling Wizard Mr. Profundo has arrived in town, seeking to delight local children and adults alike. Mr. Mackerton however does not seem pleased and seems to know a little more about this Mr. Profundo than he’s letting on. After Mr. Profundo is seen heading up to Salt Lick Farm, maybe it’s time to pay Mr. Mackerton a visit.</p>
<p><em>High Risk</em></p>
<p>Mr. Mackerton prides himself on stocking the very latest in magical wonders. Latest in his acquisitions is a box of Canarian dream amulets. Best case scenario, they provide the wearer with a respite from nightmares and soothing, calming dreams. Unfortunately, some Canarain dream amulets are cursed and can catapult the wearer psychically into The Dreamlands with little to no way to return. Having stumbled upon a comatose looking Mr. Mackerton, perhaps the players are up for a trip into their own heads?</p>

Well that&#8217;s it folks! We made it through the first season of Westworld. As the prophecy foretold, these violent delights did have violent ends.</p>
<p>Maeve finally achieves sentients&#8230;or does she, Dolores finds the center of the maze, Ford has an abrupt ending, Bernard gets a second chance at &#8220;life&#8221;, and we find out the true identity of the Man in Black. It turns out he&#8217;s a business man.</p>
<p>This really was an incredibly strong opening season. Every episode was exciting. We don&#8217;t know exactly what next season will hold, but its going to be very different based on the ending of season 1!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My coworkers know that I am obsessed with board games and frequently promise that they will grace me with their presence at my next board gaming event. However, life happens so these plans just don’t work out. But we still talk about it like it will happen in the very near future. Well, if your coworkers can’t make it to your board game nights, why not bring the games to your coworkers? Better yet, why not enhance your breaks during your workday by sneaking in a game at work? Board games promote a low-stress environment in which people can unwind for a much needed break from the hustle and bustle of the work day. They can also bring out qualities and personalities in people that you or they had no idea existed. Who knew that sweet little Betty Sue is a master at bluffing games?</p>
<p>When choosing a board game for a work environment, there are a few factors to consider: the game’s playtime, size, and the number of people who can play. Though I have managed to fit in a game of <em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em> in a (very long) lunch break, not everyone has coworkers who want to/can spend hours in the middle of a work day playing a game. Furthermore, work environments don’t typically contain <a href="http://www.geekchichq.com/" target="_blank">Geek Chic</a> gaming tables, so the spread of the game is very important to consider. This means that card games are probably your best bet. Also, try to get a survey of how many players you might have in a session to decide what games to bring, but also consider onlookers who might want to jump in after seeing how much fun you are having!</p>
<p>Below you will find some of my favorite and most successful games for lunch breaks.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup" target="_blank"><strong>Coup</strong></a></li>
</ol>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-42455 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Coup-200x300.png" alt="coup" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Coup-200x300.png 200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Coup-298x447.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Coup-620x929.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Coup.png 664w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><strong>Number of Players: 2-6 (2-10 with Coup: Reformation expansion)<br />
Playtime: 15-30 minutes</strong></p>
<p>I love bluffing games, and <em>Coup</em> is one of my favorites. Perhaps it says something about my personality, but I love exercising my deceptive abilities. In <em>Coup</em>, players have influence over politicians in a corrupt government. Players must bribe and bluff to maintain that influence while also trying to destroy the influence of the other players. This influence is represented by character cards. On their turn, players announce who they have influence over, and complete actions based on whom that influence is. The player does not have to be truthful and the other players can call MELARKEY on what others say. If the accuser is incorrect, they lose one influence. If the accuser is correct, the bluffer loses an influence. In Coup, the last player standing wins.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-42470 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lklkjkljkl-300x181.jpg" alt="lklkjkljkl" width="502" height="303" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lklkjkljkl-300x181.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lklkjkljkl-768x464.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lklkjkljkl-1200x725.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lklkjkljkl-298x180.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lklkjkljkl-620x375.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /><br />
This game is a fantastic choice for a lunch break. Its compactness makes it easy to carry in a bag and it also takes up little space at the table. Furthermore, players don’t really have to handle components of the game that often. You can still accomplish quite a bit in the game by just talking to the other players and keeping your cards face down in front of you. Furthermore, the game is short. I am usually not a fan of elimination games, but during lunch, it can be good since it gives people a chance to eat. This game is also very social. Oftentimes, accusations lead to discussions about how the accuser could ever think that the accused would lie, at which point the entire table pitches in to present the evidence they have to think this. This will lead to continued laughs throughout the day with my group of friends.</p>

</ul>
<p><img class=" wp-image-42459 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Hanabi-300x224.jpg" alt="hanabi" width="396" height="296" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Hanabi-300x224.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Hanabi-768x574.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Hanabi-1200x896.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Hanabi-298x223.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Hanabi-620x463.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Hanabi.jpg 1319w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" /></p>
<p><strong>Number of Players: 2-5<br />
Playtime: 25 mins</strong></p>
<p><em>Hanabi</em> is a cooperative game in which the players “build” a firework show together. To do this, the players attempt to place cards down in an order determined by color and number. However, players have no idea what cards they hold in their hands. This game takes a little getting used to at first because you do not look at your hand of cards; you hold them away from you so that the OTHER players know what you have. On a player’s turn, they can inform another player about their cards and the position(s) in the hand that they are in. This will help the players decide what card to play on their turn.</p>
<p>Like <em>Coup</em>, this game is compact and easy to carry around. It also takes up very little space at the table. One downside of this game is that it is not color-blind friendly. Also, it can be awkward since everyone has to hold their cards up the entire time. It could make eating difficult if you don’t have a meal that can be simply eaten with a fork. This game would be more appropriate for a coffee break. The game itself is very short though, and could be something that gets played once everyone has wolfed down their food and still has a bit of time left in their break. Much like <em>Coup</em>, it is also a very social game since the primary goal is for everyone to effectively communicate hints that inform fellow players what cards to play. This exercise in effective communication is another reason this is a great game to share with coworkers.</p>

<p><strong>Number of Players: 2-8<br />
Playtime: 30 mins</strong></p>
<p>I would recommend <em>Tsuro of the Seas</em> if you and your coworkers are feeling especially bold and want to make an attempt at playing a board game at work. This game is beautifully simple and quick. Players take on the role of boat captains who are navigating waters ruled by dragons. Players put down tiles that provide a path for the ship to get away from the dragons while also avoiding the other players’ boats. This is an elimination game, so last boat standing wins. Boats can also knock out other boats if players are clever with their tile placement.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-42456 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Tsuro-again-300x169.jpg" alt="tsuro-again" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Tsuro-again-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Tsuro-again-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Tsuro-again-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Tsuro-again-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Tsuro-again.jpg 1019w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>I believe that <em>Tsuro of the Seas</em> is one of the best options for playing a board game at work. It is fairly compact for a board game and doesn’t require a terrible amount of space at the table. Also, it is easy to explain. The game design is beautiful and could attract onlookers (the new networking strategy?!). One downside to choosing this game is that it does not incorporate as much player interaction as both <em>Hanabi</em> and <em>Coup</em>. If you are looking to enhance the “synergy” of your work environment, I would recommend <em>Hanabi</em> before <em>Tsuro of the Seas</em>. However, the social aspect of <em>Tsuro of the Seas</em> can be improved by exploring what kinds of ships you are commanding, why you are sailing this sea, imagining how your crew members are reacting to seeing dragons in the ocean, and making fun whooshing noises as you move your boat around.</p>
<p><strong><u>Honorable Mentions:</u></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.maydaygames.com/collections/get-bit/products/get-bit-original" target="_blank"><strong>Get Bit!</strong></a> I didn’t include this game in my main recommendations because I have not played it myself. However, I have heard very positive reviews about this game and it seems that it would be a fantastic option to play at lunch time with coworkers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.explodingkittens.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Exploding Kittens</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A fun game that incorporates artwork from <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/" target="_blank">The Oatmeal</a>. The cards are hilarious and could attract those who don’t typically like to play games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alderac.com/loveletter" target="_blank"><strong>Love Letter</strong></a><strong>: </strong>I am a horrible person who has not yet played this game. Love Letter is extremely popular due to its short playtime and travel size. I could see this game being a successful choice at a lunch/coffee break.</p>
<p><strong>There are many more options in addition to the ones I mentioned above. Please share some of your ideas and experiences in the comments below! </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have uncovered more information about the final GeeklyCon House, as well as some interesting facts about the tournament. From a printed email from 2006, we learn that House Nahvalr was winning the House Cup when the tournament was abruptly canceled.  The reasons are still a mystery to us. We will continue to research and report on the cause of the cancellation when possible.</p>
<p>We have also decided to bring the House Cup back for GeeklyCon 2017! You can read up on the <a href="https://geeklycon.com/pages/the-house-cup-rules">House Cup rules here</a>. The first step to joining in on the fun is to be <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/sorting.php">sorted into your house</a>. Only GeeklyCon ticket holders will be sorted.</p>
<p>To learn more about GeeklyCon and get tickets, <a href="http://www.geeklycon.com/">go here</a>!</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi Brenna,</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do I have a story for you?!  So, you know I was at GeeklyCon 2006 in Bangalore, India.  GC was a blast like always and all 5 Houses were competing for the House Cup something fierce (well, fierce but still in a semi-friendly manner like in the years past&#8230;you remember!).  Well anywho, through the whole time at GC, House Nahvalr was winning&#8230;like we were poised to win the whole damn thing.  No other house was even close to us but then all hell broke loose.  THE GC ORGANIZERS FREAKING CANCELED THE HOUSE CUP TOURNAMENT!!  CAN YOU EVEN BELIEVE IT???</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, House Nahvalr was broken hearted.  How could this even happen?  We were so close to winning!! The organizers gave no reasons as to why the tournament was canceled &#8211; they were holed up in a secret meeting for hours before and after the announcement.  Of course everyone has their own theory about why the tournament was canceled but I have the real answer: THE ILLUMINATI.  I mean, they’re probably reading this email as we speak &#8211; they have their hands in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I hope everything is going well with you.  I know you were sad about missing GC this year but there’s always next year!  I’m at the airport, waiting on my flight back home.  See you soon!</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love, </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry</span></em></p></blockquote>

In this postcard from GeeklyCon Liverpool, a member of House Wigglebottom alludes to a prank played on &#8220;House Narvahl&#8221;, which we are assuming is a typo since that isn&#8217;t a word.</p>
<p>To learn more about GeeklyCon and get tickets, <a href="http://www.geeklycon.com/">go here</a>!</p>
<blockquote><p>supposed to be a prank on Narvahl since they beat us out by only a few points last year, but it may have gotten out of hand?  I mean, this was the only picture taken and you can barely even see the Griffins!</p>
<p>Were having the time of our lives in Liverpol, I only wish you could be here with us!  I’ve made so many new friends, and they’re incredibly welcoming! I’ll beg the parents to let us both g to Geeklycon next year, groovy?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can we talk about <em>Shadow of the Demon Lord</em>? Have you seen this game yet? You haven’t? Well let me tell you about some of the reasons why I’m in love with this game, and why you should at the very LEAST play it everyday of the week. That might be too much, TRY it.. At the very least just try it every day of the week.. Or occasionally. I’ll run it for you… because I love running it, so let’s play!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42460" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl1.png" alt="sotdl1" width="287" height="160" /></p>
<p>I’d like to start with the Man, the creator, Robert Schwalb. Robert has been in the industry now for over 10 years. He’s had his demonically majestic fingers all over <em>Dungeon and Dragons</em>, the<em> A Song of Ice and Fire</em> RPG,<em> Warhammer, Star Wars Saga Edition, Numenera</em>, I mean.. I could go on; he’s everywhere. In 2014 he launched Schwalb Entertainment and <em>Shadow of the Demon Lord</em> went up on Kickstarter. I’ve had the opportunity to meet him and play in games run by him and I was immediately elated that I backed the game. Oh, and he’s an awesome guy, by the way. Very responsive to the community. Take a look at the <em>Shadow of the Demon Lord’s</em> Google+ group to see how often he answers posts and keeps the community updated on changes to PDF’s and all the different products that have been coming out for the game. There is enough content on Drive Thru RPG for this game to keep you busy for quite a while and it’s all sickeningly magnificent!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42462" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl6.jpg" alt="The Lands of Rul" width="237" height="300" /></p>
<p><em>Shadow of the Demon Lord’s</em> setting is one of a world well on the way toward its own destruction. The planet is called “Urth”, and the continent is called “Rũl”.The Demon Lord itself is too large to enter the world for now, but smaller cracks in reality are what allow the terrifying entities that spawn from this darkness to enter and cause just, all the mayhem! Of course it doesn’t help that there are numerous cults, corrupted individuals, and organizations that seek to usher in the Demon Lord’s reign so all of the “Void” can break loose and…well&#8230;you know, do what demons do. Horror is its cornerstone with horrifying visualization and description being what brings the games to life. The game is also not lacking in visceral grotesqueness that if you actual beheld, would drive you MAD!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42468" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl5.jpg" alt="sotdl5" width="198" height="255" /></p>
<p>So let’s talk about how the game is played. Much like traditional RPG’s we all know and love, we have a target number that we must hit with a d20 roll for success. The target numbers and how we can affect the dice rolls are where things get interesting. There are challenge rolls and attack rolls. Challenge rolls, which are your “saves” and your basic “skill checks” are always rolled against a target number of ten… always. Attack rolls are made either against a target&#8217;s defense score or a specific attribute, if you were trying to affect its mind or persuade a target, rather than hit it with a sword. Each character has 4 attribute scores, Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Will. Each score may, or may not provide a modifier to add to your rolls. I say “may not” provide a modifier because starting characters will have on average a +1 or no modifier at all. That will improve with advancement but can be surprising at first. But don’t worry, there is hope! Aside from the normal bonuses and penalties that can affect a given roll, <em>Shadow of the Demon Lord</em> uses “boons” and “banes” to indicate when circumstances make things easier or harder. They are represented by a d6 and if you have a boon you add the total to the d20 roll, and if you have a bane you subtract the total from the d20 roll. Boons and banes cancel each other out so if you have two boons and three banes you make your roll with 1 bane. Sometimes you may end up with multiple boons or multiple banes. If I’m rolling a challenge roll with 2 boons, I roll a d20 and 2 d6’s. I take whatever d6 is highest and add that single die roll to the d20 roll. Easy peasey. The more boons you can accumulate the better chance you have rolling a higher number to add. Likewise the more banes you are given improve your chances of subtracting a higher number. There is a myriad of different abilities and path specific powers or traits that will add boons or banes when you are using them.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42464" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl3.jpg" alt="sotdl3" width="2335" height="837" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl3.jpg 2335w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl3-300x108.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl3-768x275.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl3-1200x430.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl3-298x107.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl3-620x222.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 2335px) 100vw, 2335px" /></p>
<p>I guess that sort of leads right into the types of characters available for players. There are no real “classes” in <em>Shadow of the Demon Lord</em>. The advancement system is unique in that you start at level 0 and pick an “ancestry”. There are many that have been added through supplements and other materials, but in the core book we have Human, Changeling, Clockwork, Dwarf, Goblin, and Orc. All have specific setting based reasons for existing and what part they played in the history of Rũl. So you pick an ancestry, then you pick some professions that sound cool and fit your idea of who your character is. These professions can be used by the player or the GM to determine if the character might get a boon on a particular challenge roll, or whether or not something the character tries to do just happens&#8230;Or NOT. The basic structure of adventure as it relates to traditional “leveling up” is the concept of the group level. The party levels together. At the end of an adventure, no matter how long it takes, you level up. Leveling up brings with it some interesting options referred to as “Paths”. After completing the starting adventure you achieve level 1 and get to choose a Novice path. Your options at this level are Magician, Priest, Rogue, and Warrior. Each provide different benefits and abilities at different levels going forward. At level 3 you choose an Expert path. These are more specialized paths that provide even more benefits and abilities. Cleric, Sorcerer, Paladin, and Ranger are a few of the choices you will have. At level 7 you choose a &#8220;Master Path&#8221;. Here you’ll find even more options including Bard, Exorcist, Templar, Sharpshooter, and many others adding even more depth to your character. As you gain levels each and every path is available to you. There are no prerequisites other than a good story reason why. So there is nothing that says I couldn’t start out as a warrior whose story throughout the campaign has led me to discover the “Forbidden Magic Tradition”…well now I’ll probably take the “Apocalyptist Master Path” and be this brooding forlorn fighter who casts spells that are actively corrupting my very SOUL! The core book alone provides many choices and seemingly countless combinations to satisfy every character concept you might have. Currently the levels are capped at 10, but future supplements will indeed expand on this.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42466" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl4.png" alt="sotdl4" width="426" height="551" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl4.png 426w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl4-232x300.png 232w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl4-298x385.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></p>
<p>I would be INSANE to not mention the corruption and insanity mechanics that anchors this system. Whenever as a player, you would behold something truly horrifying the players must make a will challenge roll. A failure results in the character gaining an insanity point and becoming afraid which manifests mechanically with a bane to all challenge and attack rolls for a certain number of rounds. As a campaign goes on there are plenty of opportunities to go insane and once your insanity level reaches your will score… you go MAD! There is a madness table that you roll a d20 on and you suffer those consequences. Most madness eventually wears off and your insanity will go down some. You may also take a lasting effect, referred to in game as a “quirk” in order to reduce your insanity level even more. These quirks permanently affect your character and are mostly story / roleplay based, but will most likely cause complications in some situations. Corruption on the other hand, is gained when you willingly participate in something truly vile. Murder, harming innocents, stealing for your personal gain, learning spells from the Forbidden or Necromancy traditions, and anything else you could think of that would darken your soul! As your corruption score goes up you suffer certain effects that will occur naturally the higher your score gets. Children cry and try to get as far away from you as possible. Animals are instantly hostile towards you and attack rolls within in social situations are made with one bane. Each time you gain corruption you must roll a d20. If the roll is less than your current corruption level then you gain a “Mark of Darkness”. There is a table that you would roll on that would give you marks such as a pair of horns begin to grow from your forehead, or your reproductive organs shrivel and fall off, or out of your body… you know, things like that.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42473" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl2.jpg" alt="sotdl2" width="384" height="99" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl2.jpg 384w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl2-300x77.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sotdl2-298x77.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></p>
<p>There’s a lot here, but the bottom line in my opinion, is that <em>Shadow of the Demon Lord</em> streamlines a lot of what makes RPG’s great while still offering a good amount of crunch if you want to go the optimization route. I’ve played and ran a bunch of games and it’s right on the top of my list of favorites. If you like insanity inducing horrific fear filled fun, I recommend you give this game a shot. I’m trying to run it as much as possible to showcase it in all it’s glory so if anyone is interested, and we can work out the timing I’d be happy to run. HAPPY GAMING!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-42196 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Fry-300x225.jpg" alt="coffee-fry" width="879" height="659" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Fry-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Fry-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Fry-620x465.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Fry.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" /></p>
<p>I love coffee. It&#8217;s warm, intense, flavorful and, most importantly, has caffeine!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s getting to the point that I like to grind my own beans and make specialty coffees on the weekend. Between my french press, moka pot, and Vietnamese phin filter, it’s hard to choose sometimes.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t always like coffee. I mainly rediscovered it during a trip to Vietnam with my wife. Before that, I used between 1-3 energy drinks per day at work and maybe a soda or energy drink on my weekends. I would always have one during gaming sessions for D&amp;D or Warcraft.</p>
<p>So what is the science behind caffeine that helps us stay awake or more alert? (Although, it seems to make some people sleepy.) The chemical formula of caffeine is: C8H10N4O2 (meaning 8 carbon atoms, 10 hydrogen, 4 nitrogen, and 2 oxygen) and while considered a drug, it has been deemed generally accepted as safe for everyday use for the majority of the healthy population.</p>
<p>While largely consumed throughout history (potentially first discovered via tea), it was first isolated (removed chemically) from coffee by Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge in 1819. Later in 1859, the chemist Hermann Emil Fischer first synthesized caffeine from its base components.</p>
<p>Enough history. While interesting, isn’t quite relevant when you drink your soda.</p>
<p>Caffeine takes a while to cycle through your system. Consensus is that it takes roughly 5 hours for half of your caffeine intake to pass through your system. So let’s take my college days&#8230;it&#8217;s finals week, I’ve started my day rough, I need a two shot mocha just before class at 8 am, I’ll get done with this block by 12 pm, have [non-color specific bovine] drink (16 oz) and, while I relax playing some Diablo 2 at 8 pm, I’ll have a Mountain Dew (12 oz). Three sources of caffeine isn’t too bad, I’ve heard of worse…to the Science Lab!!!!</p>

<p>As you can see, while the amount of caffeine in my system reduces slowly over the course of the day, it spikes whenever I had a drink. This caused my net caffeine level to stay over 64 mg (1 shot of espresso) for over 17 hours and, even after I fell asleep and till I woke up the next morning, I STILL had caffeine in my system from the day before!</p>
<p>So what does this mean? Do I need to drink less caffeine? Am I overdoing it? Can you eventually overdose on caffeine this way? Well like any complex system, it’s hard to say. I certainly gained weight during that time but that was very likely due to all the sugar and sitting I was doing. I did get the jitters now and then and was dehydrated a lot. You can overdose on caffeine, but it takes an incredible amount in order to do so over an incredibly short amount of time. One such death was a 19 year old who took two dozen caffeine pills. The total amount ingested and metabolized was 4800 mg of caffeine (that’s roughly 100 drip coffees within ). I’m nowhere near that and, very likely, neither is the typical consumer. As with everything from video games to tabletop RPG’s to food and exercise, <em>moderation is key</em>. So know what you are doing to yourself and you’ll feel better knowing how to hack your body.</p>

<p>At long last, Disney&#8217;s <em>Moana</em> has hit the theaters and, after patiently waiting its debut, I can confidently tell you wonderful people that it did not disappoint! I already have plans to see it for a third time!</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-42379 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/moananew-300x126.jpg" alt="moananew" width="899" height="378" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/moananew-300x126.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/moananew-768x322.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/moananew-1200x503.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/moananew-298x125.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/moananew-620x260.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px" /></p>
<p>Starring newcomer Auli’i Cravalho and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, <em>Moana</em> is the story of a young Polynesian girl who is destined to become the chief of her island village. Trouble arises when the island begins to slowly wither away, leaving behind little to no resources for the villagers. Following the wise words of her grandmother, Moana voyages out to the unknown ocean in search of the demigod Maui to force him to return the heart of the goddess Te Fiti in order to reverse the curse that has befallen her home. The film features songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Opetaia Foa’i, and a score by Mark Mancina.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-42376 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/maxresdefault-300x169.jpg" alt="maxresdefault" width="973" height="548" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/maxresdefault-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/maxresdefault-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/maxresdefault-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/maxresdefault-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/maxresdefault-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/maxresdefault.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px" /></p>
<p><em>Moana</em> has it all &#8211; great songs, vibrant visuals, a talented cast, and a new, engaging story. But what really made it stand out for me is all the lore and the research that the team behind it included in the story. Everything from the way the villagers used all parts of the coconuts that they ate, down to the way they gave their tattoos. The care and the accuracy put into the movie was extremely impressive. The directors were so dedicated to making sure that all elements of the story were as culturally accurate as possible that an Oceanic Story Trust was put together of a team of experts from the South Pacific to consult on the film.</p>

<p>As someone of Islander descent, this movie was amazing. While it wasn&#8217;t the first DIsney film to be set in the Pacific Islands (<em>Lilo and Stitch</em> was set in Hawaii and is also fantastic), it is the first to embrace our cultural heritage and I left the theater with a deep sense of pride for my people. Do yourself a huge favor and check out <em>Moana</em> today!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-42218 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/allied_ver2-192x300.jpg" alt="allied_ver2" width="404" height="631" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/allied_ver2-192x300.jpg 192w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/allied_ver2-298x465.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/allied_ver2.jpg 484w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" />When I heard the news back in September that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were splitting up I, like a lot of the internet, was shocked and stunned. I mean, if they can‘t keep their shit together what hope do the rest of us have trying to hold onto (or find) love, right? When I expressed my dismay on Facebook, a friend asked me if I’d seen the trailer for the soon to be released WW2 film starring him and Marion Cotillard and suggested that adulterous hijinx were at play… you know, “The Bone Dance”, “Park The Porpoise”, “Hide The Salami”, “The Horizontal Tango”… After hearing, that bit of news, I immediately rushed to the internet to watch said trailer, and that is all it took. Much like a gawking, rubber-necked driver passing an unfortunate auto accident with the hopes of seeing something unsettling or perhaps downright graphic, my hopes were for this movie that somewhere in there, somehow I’d see maybe a little bit of the sinister and corrosive spark that would ultimately lead to the doom of one of Hollywood’s most powerful couples. I didn&#8217;t really find any of that but instead was treated a very good movie.</p>
<p>The story takes place in 1942 during the 2<sup>nd</sup> world war and centers on Canadian intelligence officer Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) and French Resistance fighter Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard). Posing as married Parisian sympathizers for Hitler’s cause, they have been tasked by the British government to assassinate a German ambassador during a gala event in North Africa. Having never met before receiving the full details of their assignment, it doesn’t take very long before their cover as a young couple madly in love turns into a reality. When they complete the deadly assignment, seemingly without a hitch, Max petitions the British government to grant Marianne citizenship and when the government does so, the two become married and shortly after, have their first child. While Marianne eagerly embraces her new life as a loving mother and wife, Max dutifully continues his intelligence work. Everything appears to be coming up roses for the two until shortly after their daughter&#8217;s first birthday, Max’s superiors inform him that they have strong reason to believe that Marianne was never a part of the French resistance but in fact is a German spy.<img class=" wp-image-42213 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/allied-marion-cotillard-brad-pitt-1-300x225.jpg" alt="allied-marion-cotillard-brad-pitt" width="524" height="393" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/allied-marion-cotillard-brad-pitt-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/allied-marion-cotillard-brad-pitt-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/allied-marion-cotillard-brad-pitt-1-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/allied-marion-cotillard-brad-pitt-1-620x465.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/allied-marion-cotillard-brad-pitt-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" /></p>
<p>Pitt and Cotillard play brilliantly off of each other (and if Angelina’s private investigator findings were accurate, ON TOP of each other as well, heyyy ooohhhhh….ok that was trash and I’m ashamed of myself). They both bring subtle nuances to their characters that, while not overpowering, are still quite effective in making you believe that these two strangers could fall for each other in a rather small period of time.  As far as the sexual chemistry between them is concerned, the scene in which they finally decide to cross over from a professional relationship to a personal one is definitely memorable in how its shot and the setting it’s shot in but frankly is pretty tame. The secondary characters in <em>Allied</em> are fleshed out and performed well enough not to detract from the star power on full display but do little to stand out either. Jared Harris’s performance as Max’s immediate superior and friend, Frank, and Simon McBurney&#8217;s brief but intense performance as the head of “V Section” are the exceptions. Lizzy Caplan plays Max’s lesbian sister Margaret, a character that feels like it should be in an entirely different movie. She has so little screen time it makes me wonder if there was more of her in the film that just didn’t make the final edit. Story-wise, <em>Allied</em> takes the first 30 minutes or so to set up the hook, then spends the rest of its run time teasing you, prodding you and at a decent pace, guides you towards a tension-filled emotion-drenched conclusion while peppering in well-timed bits of action and heart-string plucking sentiment.  As far as the ending goes, without giving away any spoilers, I found it satisfying. Personally, I don’t like it when movies tell me the moral of their story at the end, especially when there was plenty of evidence throughout the movie where you showed me already but I will give <em>Allied</em> a pass on this because of its solid presentation leading up to it.  <img class=" wp-image-42214 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/maxresdefault-1-300x169.jpg" alt="maxresdefault" width="536" height="302" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/maxresdefault-1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/maxresdefault-1-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/maxresdefault-1-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/maxresdefault-1-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/maxresdefault-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" /></p>
<p>With all this said, what REALLY got me about this movie was the cascade of relationship questions that it provokes and leaves you with after the credits are done. Should a loss or betrayal of trust by one or both parties in a relationship doom it to failure? How much of a betrayal does it take for that to happen? What if there’s no definitive proof of such a betrayal? Is going into a relationship with a self-serving agenda okay if said agenda doesn’t directly affect the other partner in a negative way? Does parenthood somehow earn you more wiggle room when it comes to forgiveness? If the offending party is super f*cking hot does that make it all okay? As a divorced man in his early 40’s (very early, super duper hyper early 40&#8217;s) who holds the hope of someday soon entering into a healthy long-term romantic relationship the themes of love and trust in <em>Allied</em> stood out and spoke to me, and when a movie presents its themes that way, I give it my reviewer love in return.</p>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION: </strong></p>
<p>Yes, go see this in theaters right now! In fact, if you have one, see this with your significant other. Enjoy the romance, the tension, and the emotion it provides then go home and make sweet sweet love to him or her appreciating the fragile yet brilliant joy you both share as committed partners and then, while you’re basking in the gentle fog of coital bliss, think about (in excruciating detail) every shady or questionable thing they’ve ever said or done to you and wonder if deep deep down…they’ve been playing you for a fool all along…</p>
<p><strong>RATING: 3.5 STARS (out of 5)</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN WATCH ALONG WITH (OR INSTEAD OF) THIS:</strong></p>
<p>The 2005 Brad Pitt betrayal movie that started it all, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. It’s also a pretty fun and charming action movie to be fair.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In October of 2015, it was announced that Lionsgate had won a bidding war for the rights to adapt <em>The Kingkiller Chronicle</em> by Patrick Rothfuss for film, television, and video games. Now over a year later, creator and former star of Hamilton <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/lin-manuel-miranda-produce-feature-film-tv-series-kingkiller-chronicle/">has signed on to produce the adaptation.</a> From the article from <em>The Wrap:</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Miranda will serve as a producer and “musical mastermind,” and will compose original music, as well as write the songs. Miranda also has an option to be involved in future stage adaptations of the books as well.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Miranda calls Rothfuss&#8217;s books &#8220;among the most read and re-read in our home&#8221; citing Chapter Fifty-Nine of <em>The Name of the Wind </em>as inspiration for &#8220;The Story of Tonight&#8221; from the hit Broadway musical <em>Hamilton.</em></p>
<div class="video">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Story Of Tonight is me trying to capture the feel of Kvothe &amp; his friends leaving the Eaolian, <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickRothfuss">@PatrickRothfuss</a>. <a href="https://t.co/vLiXDLPmbq">https://t.co/vLiXDLPmbq</a></p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Before the Lionsgate deal was even set in stone Lin-Manuel Miranda, in response to a fan on Twitter, told Rothfuss &#8220;if you&#8217;re interested in adapting your masterpiece, call me first.&#8221;</p>
<div class="video">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Brian_Geffen">@Brian_Geffen</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickRothfuss">@PatrickRothfuss</a> But Patrick, if you&#39;re interested in adapting your masterpiece, call me first. Huge admirer of your writing.</p>
<p>&mdash; Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/610930231269048320">June 16, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At this point, Hamilton had not yet premiered on Broadway. Back in Mid-June of this year, while discussing theater with Max Temkin, his co-host of <a href="https://unattendedconsequences.simplecast.fm/">Unattended Consequences</a> and one of the creators of Cards Against Humanity, Rothfuss said this of Miranda:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It turns out Lin-Manuel is a fan of my books and I&#8217;m kind of a fan of a bunch of the stuff he does as well, to say nothing of the fact he&#8217;s got style in spades. He&#8217;s got this swagger. I have a weird pipe dream if he was a little bit younger he could play Kvothe in the movie. Then actually I was thinking no, not Kvothe. He could be Kvothe&#8217;s dad. I think he would be an amazing Arliden. He has music all the way through him and he&#8217;s beautiful and he&#8217;s proud and to be able to bring a legitimate ethnic to play one of the [Edema] Ruh it would help resolve one of my lingering fears about Hollywood doing its typical all white people thing in my movie. He could bring a lot to that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of the podcast in June of this year, <em>Hamilton</em> was at the height of its hype. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen Hamilton.&#8221; Rothfuss says, &#8220;It&#8217;s been praying my mind more and more. He&#8217;s going to stop playing Hamilton.&#8221; He openly admits with his co-host Max Tempkin, one of the creators of<em> Cards Against Humanity</em>, that they are cynical about how good <em>Hamilton</em> could really be with Rothfuss calling the two of them &#8220;curmudgeons.&#8221; He had the same experience with <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> and Joss Whedon who he now openly admits to being a &#8220;missionary for his work&#8221; when previously he thought &#8220;I&#8217;ll be goddamned before I watch your stupid vampire cheerleader show.&#8221;  However, he called seeing Lin-Manuel Miranda perform on Broadway in <em>Hamilton</em> in 2016 as a moment in time he felt he should experience.</p>

<p>When the <em>Kingkiller </em>author eventually saw Hamilton, the two creators met backstage with Rothfuss giving the <em>Hamilton</em> star a replica of Eolian Talent Pipes, given to characters who put on an amazing musical performance at the tavern the Eolian in his books. After seeing <i>Hamilton</i>, Rothfuss called the happiness it gave him &#8220;Hamilton sickness&#8221; on the next podcast he recorded. On his live stream the day of the announcement, the author called his feelings towards Miranda as a &#8220;creative crush&#8221; that he hasn&#8217;t felt since Joss Whedon. The author&#8217;s appreciation and affection for Lin-Manuel Miranda reach such a height that Rothfuss commissioned an artist to draw the two as Don Quixote and Sancho Panza specifically from, according to him, the musical <em>Man of La Mancha. </em>With Patrick Rothfuss having a direct creative hand in the adaptation of his work and Lin-Manuel Miranda having the author&#8217;s blessing,<i> The Kingkiller Chronicle</i> film and television show should be in good hands.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Put on your Stillsuit and mount your sandworm &#8211; Legendary Entertainment has acquired the film and television rights to Frank Herbert&#8217;s <em>Dune. </em>In the past, the novel was made into a film in the &#8217;80s directed by David Lynch and starring Kyle MacLachlan and a miniseries on SyFy (then the Sci Fi Channel) in the early 2000s, starring Alec Newman. As recently as 2008, a film was attempted by Paramount Pictures.</p>

<p>Legendary Entertainment released this press release via <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/legendary-dune-frank-herbert-1201923648/">Variety</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>LEGENDARY ENTERTAINMENT ACQUIRES RIGHTS TO FRANK HERBERT’S CLASSIC SCI-FI NOVEL DUNE</p>
<p>Burbank, CA – November 21, 2016 – Legendary and the Frank Herbert estate have reached an agreement granting the production entity the film and television motion picture rights to the beloved novel DUNE, one of the most revered science fiction novels of all time. The agreement calls for the development and production of possible film and television projects for a global audience. The projects would be produced by Thomas Tull, Mary Parent and Cale Boyter, with Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt and Kim Herbert serving as executive producers.</p>
<p>Set in the distant future, Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides whose family accepts control of the desert planet Arrakis. As the only producer of a highly valuable resource, control of Arrakis is highly contested among the noble families. After Paul and his family are betrayed, the story explores themes of politics, religion, and man’s relationship to nature as Paul leads a rebellion to restore his family’s control of Arrakis.</p>
<p>Dune has long been considered the crown jewel of science fiction properties. Its legacy and influence is witnessed in everything from STAR WARS to THE MATRIX and often referred to as the science fiction version of LORD OF THE RINGS with its sprawling world and multi-dimensional politics.</p>
<p>The agreement was negotiated by Mike Ross and Jen Grazier on behalf of Legendary and Marcy Morris and Barry Tyerman of JTWAMMK on behalf of the Herbert family.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_42135" style="width: 869px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-42135" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/legendary-pictures-logo1.jpg" alt="Legendary Entertainment." width="859" height="537" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/legendary-pictures-logo1.jpg 720w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/legendary-pictures-logo1-300x188.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/legendary-pictures-logo1-298x186.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/legendary-pictures-logo1-620x388.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Legendary Entertainment.</p></div>
<p>Legendary Entertainment is no stranger to science fiction. They may best be known Christopher Nolan&#8217;s <em>The Dark Knight </em>series of movies but also includes <em>Man of Steel, </em><em>Jurassic World, Interstellar, Godzilla, Warcraft,</em> and <em>Pacific Rim</em><em>. </em>Whether the entertainment acquired rights to the novel&#8217;s sequels <em>Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, </em>or <em>God Emperor of Dune </em>is unclear from the press release citing only the events of the first novel.</p>
<p>With the rise of high budget television shows like <em>Game of Thrones, Westworld,</em> and Marvel&#8217;s original series on Netflix the possibility of a <em>Dune </em>television series that would continue into the sequels isn&#8217;t unlikely. However, if Legendary has only acquired the rights to the first novel they may decide a single film may be the better route to go. Either way, the world of <em>Dune </em>is rich with history, culture, lands, and characters that would make for a welcome addition to television or film.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yet another transcription has been completed from the recently found GeeklyCon cache. Like the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/cache-of-historical-geeklycon-letters-and-memorabilia-found/">House Marewick</a> and <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/second-house-revealed-in-geeklycon-cache-news-clipping/">House Puddlefoot</a> installments, evidence of a third house winning a GeeklyCon contest has been unearthed. A 1999 press release from <strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Society for the Wellbeing of Animals in Anchorage Alaska (SWAAA), shed light on the</span></strong> victorious house, which was called Cinderheart. With the press release we also found a crest, depicting a Cerberus-like three-headed hell beast. See below for transcript and scan of the original document.</p>
<p>Additional research on the cache has been completed, and we can tell you now that there are a total of five distinct GeeklyCon houses. More info is coming on the remaining two houses.</p>
<p>To learn more about GeeklyCon and get tickets, <a href="http://www.geeklycon.com/">go here</a>!</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">PRESS RELEASE</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 19, 1999. The Society for the Wellbeing of Animals in Anchorage Alaska (SWAAA) is pleased to announce the emptying of our shelters this past weekend. A group calling themselves “Geeklies” entered our shelters on July 18 and adopted all available dogs, or as the Geeklies called them, puppers and doggos. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SWAAA staff were taken aback at this request and a little suspicious. However, our concerns were laid to rest once the Geeklies explained they planned to give each pupper and doggo a home with other Geeklies who were attending GeeklyCon 1999 right here in Anchorage, Alaska. They also spoke of this being a benevolent gesture on the part of House Cinderheart, winner of GeeklyCon 1999. SWAAA staff didn&#8217;t understand a word of this but didn&#8217;t ask questions lest the Geeklies change their minds about the mass adoption. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">SWAAA would like to thank Geeklies and House Cinderheart for emptying our shelters and finding homes for all the doggos and puppers.</span></em></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Transcriptions have been completed on a second item from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/cache-of-historical-geeklycon-letters-and-memorabilia-found/">recently found GeeklyCon cache</a>. This news clipping comes from a local Boise, Idaho newspaper, and recounts the 1986 GeeklyCon tournament which was won by &#8220;House Puddlefoot&#8221;. This new house appears to have a purple worm for a mascot. See below for transcript and scan of the original document.</p>
<p>To learn more about GeeklyCon and get tickets, <a href="http://www.geeklycon.com/">go here</a>!</p>
<blockquote><p><em><b>Possible Cult Activity in Boise</b></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 25, 1986</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large disturbance was reported on July 23 at the Boise Ramada. A group of strangely dressed individuals calling themselves “Geekly-Con” were witnessed to be having some sort of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenge of the Nerds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> style competition which carried on late into the night. As it is our understanding that “geeks” are solitary, and basement dwelling people, we believe this may actually be some sort of cult or real-life reenactment of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mazes and Monsters</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were able to interview Adlynn Wilson, one of the competitors &#8211; though most of her answers were unintelligible. Ms. Wilson claimed to be part of a faction called “House Puddlefoot” whose mascot appears to be some sort of giant worm with teeth. According to Ms. Wilson, she was integral in helping these “Puddlefoots” win their annual competition. Even more bizarrely, she claimed that she clinched the competition by achieving a Pac Man “kill screen”, which sounds violent and possibly illegal to this reporter. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully this appears to have just been a one weekend occurrence. Several sources tell us that Geekly-Con will not be returning to Boise, and will take place next summer in Aspen, CO. While it seems bizarre that someone would want to visit Aspen outside of skiing season, these self-proclaimed “weirdos” seem like the types who would do just that.  </span></em></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars: Destiny</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a new collectible card and dice game that is being released by Fantasy Flight Games on December 1st. In this game players will be going head to head against their opponent trying to deal damage to the enemy characters by rolling custom dice and using their abilities, as well as timing; resulting in really interesting card play. Already with several card decks out, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Destiny</span> </em><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows for players to mix and match heroes and villains from all of the <em>Star Wars</em> universe and movies, giving players the option to pit Luke against Dooku, Fett against BB-8, or Greedo against Han; allowing players to answer the question “who shot first”.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42245" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-44.jpg" alt="picture-44" width="723" height="407" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-44.jpg 723w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-44-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-44-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-44-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game setup is  fairly simple and straightforward; players build decks of 30 cards around either hero or villain characters. Each player is able to spend up to 30 points in order to add characters to their deck. Your characters (like Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren) start out in the play area and will have unique dice associated with them. These dice give them abilities like dealing damage, gaining shields, growing their pool of resources, and making your opponent lose cards or resources. Each player is able to attach cards to their characters, some of which will come with a die that will give the character an even greater range of abilities. However, these and other cards will often have a resource cost that need to be spent in order to play them.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42246" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-47.jpg" alt="picture-47" width="723" height="407" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-47.jpg 723w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-47-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-47-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-47-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ease of game setup is carried through into the rules and player turns. Players take a single action on their turn and then pass play to their opponent. During each player’s turn, there are a few actions they can take. Some examples of these actions are playing a card from your hand, activating a character (when you do this you will roll all dice associated with that character including any dice from cards that are attached to that character), resolving dice that have been rolled, and discarding a card from your hand in order to re-roll any of your dice. This will continue until both players pass, signifying the end of round. At this time each player will ready all of their cards, gain two resources, and draw back up to a hand of five cards. In order to win the game the player needs to knockout all their opponents’ characters or at the end of a round they have need to have no cards in either their deck or hand.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42247" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-50.jpg" alt="picture-50" width="723" height="407" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-50.jpg 723w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-50-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-50-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-50-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collectible games of any kind have never been something I was interested in. I can say though that I find this game very fun. The game play is quick, simple and satisfying. The dice are a real random factor in the game but any card can be discarded to re roll your dice and many cards will allow you to mitigate the die roll in some way. While I would personally prefer a fantasy setting,  I find that the Star Wars theme really comes through as you read the abilities on the different cards and characters. Make no bones about it this is a light game but one that anyone who likes the <em>Star Wars</em> universe could get into as long as they are able to get over the collectible nature of the game.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My birthday is November 10. Back in July when Nintendo announced the NES Classic Edition, red X’s started showing up on my wall calendar, counting down to November 11th, </span><b>the day after my birthday. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew it was my destiny to get one the day it came out.</span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been one to wait in huge lines, and if something is so popular it&#8217;s causes multi-hour waits, I&#8217;m happy to pass on it until the hysteria has died down. Not this time. I grew up with a Nintendo controller in my hand. When this system was announced, the nostalgia was real. All I wanted to do was relive 1985, and share a piece of it with my kids.  In other words, I’m in the heart of the system’s target demographic.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/059e263399e6b14ab6869421b123a7f3.png" width="424" height="282" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now it’s very clear that Nintendo is up to it’s old tricks; trickling out just enough product to make everyone hot with pre-holiday lust.  How did I score mine with relatively little fuss?  It was part luck, part skill.  I called around to local retailers the night before, asking them how many systems they had in stock.  Most had between five and eight.  Fine.  I noted the opening times, which for most were 8 a.m. or before.  One specialty retailer opened at 10,and for a bit of serendipity they also had 14 systems in stock, as well as three extra controllers.  It should be noted that I live near a fairly compact commercial corridor. Most of the retail stores near me are within a three minute drive of each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ignored the bigger retail stores, and went straight for the specialty store.  I arrived at eight, noting the huge lines at nearby stores as I drove by. I made most of the wait in the comfort of my car, since the line didn’t start forming until almost nine, which was, I’m assuming, enough time for the bigger retailers to sell out.  Everyone in line was calm, friendly, pleasant and even entertaining.  We all joked about the responsibilities we were ducking to be there, and how we couldn’t even pretend this purchase was for our kids. Big kid toy, all the way.  I was third in line. Before I knew it, I was home with my new system in hand.  I’m not weird, but I literally knelt down on my living room carpet and yelled “Yes! Yes! Yes!” while laughing maniacally. This was mostly for my kid’s amusement, but not entirely.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5386128e69bedd68684e37db-1190-625/the-shawshank-redemption-accounted-for-a-huge-amount-of-cable-air-time-in-2013.jpg" alt="Image result for shawshank redemption" width="593" height="297" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how does it play?  </span><b>Exactly </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">like the original.  For a few heartbeats the controller felt way too small.  I worried the controllers were built a little smaller in the same way that they shrunk the system itself. Then I remembered I hadn’t held one since I was about ten.  I have big ‘ol meat hooks now.  The navigation menu is very minimalist.  A simple scroll left or right selects games. Press start to enter any game (duh).  From there you are playing the games in their original form.  Same menus, same screens, same bleep-bloop music that was the soundtrack of my pre-teen years. Even old cheat codes work, I&#8217;m totally not embarrassed to report. The only thing missing was an actual cartridge to blow into.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dusting off those ancient gamer skills was an absolute blast. I crushed my 9-year-old son (who regularly destroys me at any given FPS out there) in a very satisfying way.  He held up our XBOX controller saying, “I’m used to this. THIS (NES controller) is too complicated!” He later told me he likes playing my “grandpa games.” More super Mario Bros. 3 is in our future, I feel sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best feature of the system is how minimalist it is.  Nintendo added exactly what they needed to for practicality, everything else was hands-off.  At first, I even thought they forwent any type save function for any game that did not have saved games originally.  I thought this was a bold, and venerable move.  It turns out there is a save feature of a sort.  When you reset, you are taken back to the main menu.  From there you get a one-time opportunity to log a “return point.”  There are four per game. The return point more or less acts as a bookmark in the game. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few other  fun features include the “Manuals” option at the top of the screen.  Clicking there displays a QR code you can follow on your smartphone to a site that holds a digital version of all the manuals.  I thought this was a smart way to supply the books.  There is also a screen burn-in reduction feature. I’m not sure if this was necessary, or added in for fun. Turning it on activates a screensaver featuring characters from each of the games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could find relatively few drawbacks to the system, but what few there are are rather glaring.  For starters, those damn cords! The controller cords are comically short.  I have a feeling a cottage industry is going to spring up around extensions.  I’ve heard some grousing about how there isn’t a wireless option.  That’s just absurd in my mind.  This is a nostalgia piece.  Wireless controllers are completely not that.  It would have been nice if they saw fit to give the thing cords more similar to the original in length, however.  I wonder if this was a cost-cutting measure, or if they under designed the system on purpose.  The stocking-stuffer size and feel of the thing makes me a little more inclined to believe Nintendo didn’t expect the public to take it so seriously.  I think they saw it more like their version of those “500 games in one!” things you see in drugstores sometimes.  The ones that are literally just an old Atari joystick that you plug directly into your TV.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_42147" style="width: 264px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-42147" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cord-JPEG-225x300.jpg" alt="cord-jpeg" width="254" height="339" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cord-JPEG-225x300.jpg 225w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cord-JPEG-298x398.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cord-JPEG.jpg 496w" sizes="(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">About two feet of cord. Come on, Nintendo, you&#8217;re better than this.</p></div>
<p>On the subject of joysticks, I didn’t realize how pampered we are by modern controllers until I played Gradius for a few hours.  Now I know why the late 80’s and early 90’s were full of aftermarket controllers with “turbo” built into them.  My fingers are bruised!  I remember well the divots and calluses my thumbs used to bare.  I don’t remember this level of pain while earning them.  I wouldn’t call this a drawback necessarily.  Maybe it’s just because my hands are borderline geriatric.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NES Classic Edition is every bit as much of rush as I thought it would be. The lineup of preloaded games hits a perfect balance between games everyone has played, and games that made me say, “Oh! I always wanted to play that!” That was Kid Icarus for me.  I’m a little sad we won’t be playing Duck Hunt or Battle Toads anytime soon, but there are more than enough worthy titles on here to make up for it.  I recommend grabbing an NES Classic for yourself, when you get the chance. You might be waiting until January at this point, but it’s worth the wait.  As for me, I’ll be mastering Double Dragon and Ghosts and Goblins waiting for news of the release of the Super NES Classic.</span></p>

<p>So, you&#8217;ve started listening to some <em>GeeklyInc</em> podcasts and keep hearing about our wonderful community. Well, let me tell you a little about it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a part of several different communities during my internet life, from small ones based around a guild in a game, to large ones based on a love of music, games, or other interests and they&#8217;re great. Online communities give you a sense of belonging, you usually make a few friends through your shared interests and occasionally there may even be some meetups. However, in all my time on the internet, and that&#8217;s long damn time, I can honestly say I&#8217;ve never been part of a community quite like this one.<br />
The community that has grown up around <em>GeeklyInc</em> is the most accepting, kind, friendly, generous and, dare I say, loving community I&#8217;ve ever come across.</p>
<p>It might sound like hyperbole, but this community has changed (and even saved) the lives of a lot of people. Through various live streams and <em>GoFundMe</em> campaigns, this community has raised over $10,000 for charity, but it&#8217;s also helped a lot of people in the community itself. It&#8217;s been there to support people through tough times, to lend an ear to people when they needed it, and has provided countless laughs and good times. The people in the community have certainly changed me for the better and I&#8217;m sure a lot of other people would say the same thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8221;, you might be wondering &#8220;how can I get involved and become a part of this community?&#8221; Well, wonder no longer!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-42227 size-large" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-24-1200x673.jpg" alt="2016-11-24" width="620" height="348" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-24-1200x673.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-24-300x168.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-24-768x431.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-24-298x167.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-24-620x348.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to join in on the fun is to come along to the various <a href="http://twitch.tv/geeklyinc">podcast live streams</a> and talk to the people in the chat, they can sometimes be a rowdy bunch but they won&#8217;t bite (unless you want them to).</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/forums/"><em>GeeklyInc</em> forums</a>, there&#8217;s a lot of cool stuff on there and there&#8217;s always people looking for games or organizing small meetups. While not as active as it was in the past it is still a great place meet new friends.</p>
<p>If you have a <em>Twitter</em> account then tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/GeeklyInc">@geeklyinc</a>, let them know you&#8217;re new to the community, they can point you in the right direction and the friends will start rolling in. If you don&#8217;t have a <em>Twitter</em> account, then get with the program dude, it&#8217;s pretty much 2017.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve made a few friends you could join the big Geekly Hangout chat, there&#8217;s people chatting in there at all hours of the day. Pop in, say hi and everyone will be happy to welcome you to the fold. This Hangout is more or less a speakeasy&#8230;to get an invite ask another friendly Geekly community member for access. If they don&#8217;t know, well now your quest is two adventurers strong. Will you have to answer a series of questions/ riddles? No, probably not, but that does sound fun.</p>
<p>Another great way to get to know people and have some fun is the Geekly Game Nights. These usually happen ever other Friday. We&#8217;ve played a lot of different games since it&#8217;s started and it&#8217;s always great fun. We usually play free or cheap games, or games that a lot of people will likely have. You can find more information about this on the<a href="http://geeklyinc.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=1207"> forum</a>. Follow <em>GeeklyInc</em> or me (<a href="https://twitter.com/Noodzer">@Noodzer</a>).</p>
<p>While on the subject of games, there&#8217;s also <em>GeeklyInc </em>groups on <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Geeklyinc"><em>Steam</em></a>,<em> Playstation Network</em>, and <em>Xbox Live. </em>Join some of them and you&#8217;re bound to find some Geeklies to play some games with. Just search for &#8220;Geekly&#8221; on your respective platform and request an invite. There&#8217;s always Geeklies playing games or looking for others to play games with. There&#8217;s a large community of Overwatch players (on all platforms) and guilds in several games, like World of Warcraft on the Mug&#8217;thol server (Horde of course). An easy way to find people to play with is to join the <em>GeeklyInc Discord </em>server, and you can find the information for this on the forums or ask a new Geekly Friend.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1555/2831/t/3/assets/home-slider-slide-1.jpg?2755913911484613553" alt="" width="700" height="350" /></p>
<p>And last, but certainly by no means least, there&#8217;s <em>GeeklyCon</em>. What started as a couple of friends going to visit each other and a joke about making it into a convention, turned into just that. <em>GeeklyCon</em> has been going for three years now (Chicago, Louisville, Portland) and has increased in size, scope, and fun every year.<br />
<em>GeeklyCon 2017</em> is in St. Louis from the 20th-23rd July and tickets are on sale now at <a href="https://geeklycon.com/">geeklycon.com</a>. Head over and grab yours before they&#8217;re gone and join us for four days of fun. You can meet and hangout with the hosts of your favorite podcasts, see the live show, play games, attend panels, and much more. You&#8217;re bound to make some lifelong friends and some great memories.</p>
<p>There are a whole host of ways to get involved in the community, and once you do you&#8217;ll come to the same conclusion we all have, that Geeklies are the best people in the world.</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming you to the fold.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Coventry. A town located somewhere between over there and around about here. A town full of people, places and stories. Depending on who you talk to New Coventry was built on everything from fertile farming land to an ancient burial ground and was founded by pious pilgrims or lizard-headed demons. Whatever the case, New Coventry has had its share of good times and bad and it sure has a lot of stories to go around.</p>
<p>The Living Campaign series aims to bring those stories, good and bad, to the fore. Each article will explore a new place, or a new person, or some new event that’s taken place in New Coventry. It may be something good, something not so good or just something that the good folks of New Coventry just don’t like talking about.</p>
<p>The setting is rules agnostic, so feel free to pick and choose whatever you like, but the general feel is 1920’s small town; don’t expect too many dragons (maybe). If you’re running short on inspiration, every so often the Living Campaign will talk about how to use its various bits and pieces.</p>
<p>So with that, welcome to New Coventry stranger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Living Campaign: Campaign Adventures</u></strong></p>
<p>This week, we won’t be delving into the town of New Coventry and looking at a new, exciting place to explore. Rather, we’ll take a step back and look at how you might integrate the living campaign setting into your own game. We’ll give be giving you a handful of adventure hooks for each piece published so far. Some will be relatively low-risk, while others might threaten the whole town!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42096" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Diner_and_cars_1921.jpg" alt="diner_and_cars_1921" width="600" height="450" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Diner_and_cars_1921.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Diner_and_cars_1921-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Diner_and_cars_1921-298x224.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Johnson’s Eatery</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Low Risk</em></p>
<p>Ma’s boy Crispin has just bought Ma a shiny, new wireless for her birthday. Problem is, poor boy can’t find the damn thing. He sets it down on the counter one second, the next, gone. He’s come to the players, almost tears in eyes, asking if they can find it.</p>
<p><em>Medium Risk</em></p>
<p>Lately the diners seemed a little tense. The receipts just aren’t turning up as much they used to and Ma Johnson is starting to feel the squeeze. She brushes it off as a slow season. But then, she approaches the players and tells them about a new gang from the next county over looking to start drumming up protection money from New Coventry businesses. And Ma Johnson’s first on the list…</p>
<p><em>High Risk</em></p>
<p>“Hank? Hoo-ee, well that boy was always a bit of trouble, having dreams of being a writer and all”. But now it seems that Hank has gotten in a little over his head. In his pursuit for a little more research for his book, Hank’s gotten his hands on a copy of one of New Coventry Universities more suspect tomes. Now a quiet New Coventry Friday night is less quiet with a variety of flashing lights and yelling coming from Johnson’s Eatery. Looks like the players are dining in this evening. (Hahaha, kill me now).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42084" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ArchivesBW.jpg" alt="archivesbw" width="919" height="405" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ArchivesBW.jpg 919w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ArchivesBW-300x132.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ArchivesBW-768x338.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ArchivesBW-298x131.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ArchivesBW-620x273.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Coventry Conversation and Archive</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Low Risk</em></p>
<p>Coventry Conversation reporter Anna Ripley is convinced of strange going-ons at New Coventry Town Hall, secret meetings behind closed doors, budgets not balancing. Perhaps the players are feeling like flexing their investigatory muscles? Or maybe, if they’re feeling direct, just muscles in general.</p>
<p><em>Medium Risk</em></p>
<p>Occasionally, students will enter the microfilm archive to grab a piece of research or check some obscure fact. But now it’s looking like they’re pulling some overly long hours and a few local students who’ve gone up to the archive haven’t come out in a few days. Normally not a cause for concern, but now there’s just a little bit of screaming coming from the archive. Maybe someone needs to go take care of that?</p>
<p><em>High Risk</em></p>
<p>The Coventry Conversation is known around the town for not being afraid to cover the big stories. Whether its stories of local happenings, or op-eds on national matters, the Coventry Conversation is a beacon of journalism. The latest few issues however seem to be showing a certain bias. A bias towards eldritch forces that wish to swallow the world whole and the sheets of the Coventry Conversation appear to now be filled with arcane symbols. With the building locked up tight as of yesterday, it won’t be a slow news day (Oh god please kill me, I’m terrible).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42087" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2911671260_114368bafb.jpg" alt="2911671260_114368bafb" width="499" height="367" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2911671260_114368bafb.jpg 499w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2911671260_114368bafb-300x221.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2911671260_114368bafb-298x219.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>New Hope Housing</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Low Risk</em></p>
<p>Christmas at New Hope Housing is never the cheeriest of affairs, incomes being somehow lower than people’s spirits. But this year the local church has come together to provide a little goodwill in the form of a community tree and a few large sacks of presents. It would appear though that New Coventry has its very own Grinch with said presents vanishing in the night. A scuttling, hunched figure was last seen scampering off into the woods with a couple of sacks, perhaps that might be a place to start?</p>
<p><em>Medium Risk</em></p>
<p>The thing about New Coventry is that it’s citizens don’t like to do things the regular way. New Coventry is an independent place. From its laws, to its town hall processes and all the way down to its murders. Yep, New Coventry isn’t a stranger to a good murder and this latest one at New Hope is no exception. While most killers would have the decency to just stab someone and leave, mysteriously leaving every exit locked, New Coventry just has to make it difficult. Unit 16 is now sporting one body in its living room, sans any of its more important limbs however. And if that wasn’t enough of a headscratcher, it looks like all the windows and doors have just vanished.</p>
<p><em>High Risk</em></p>
<p>New Hope Housing has never been in the best shape. Leaky pipes, holes in the walls, unexplained substances on the floor. Unexplained substances on the walls. But, the owner, Maria Santano, does her best to keep the place standing. She has however never lost an entire duplex. Until now. With a shimmering, groaning wall of violet fog in the place where it used to be, Maria is at her wits end. It reportedly vanished late last night in a flash of light and the entire complex hasn’t been seen since. Perhaps the players have a hankering for throwing themselves into a mysterious fog?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Here are just a few ways to incorporate the weird and seemingly innocent New Coventry locations we have discovered so far. If you haven&#8217;t yet, why not wander the rest of New Coventry and check out these other previously discovered places and people!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the tease of a new game in development by the creators of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud, FlOw, Flower</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journey,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I thought it would be appropriate to recall my experiences with the last two of the four games (sadly I haven’t gotten around playing the earlier games). Thatgamecompany excels in making games that allow the player to be able to share unique experiences, and discover elaborate stories at the same time.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first picked up </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flower</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Playstation Store for the Playstation 3, I wasn’t quite sure what I was going to be getting myself into. I played the first section, and was instantly entranced as I was controlling a group of flower petals soaring around the open landscape of a grassy field. Each flower that I would bloom would add more and more petals to the group already under my control until I had a giant “flower dragon” blissfully gliding around the area. I never felt that I was being rushed to complete a level, and even tried my hardest to find every single flower to make my flying colossus as big as possible. Once I had my fill of the first area, I proceeded to next area.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_41991" style="width: 585px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-41991 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Flower-Game-Screenshot.jpg" alt="The second area that you encounter in Flower. Image taken from thatgamecompany.com/games/flower" width="575" height="323" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Flower-Game-Screenshot.jpg 575w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Flower-Game-Screenshot-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Flower-Game-Screenshot-298x167.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The second area that you encounter in Flower.<br /> Image taken from thatgamecompany.com/games/flower</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second area consisted of a winding path with rocky structures lining the sides. Same procedure, bloom your starting flower, then proceed to grow your flower petal collection while exploring this beautiful area. As I progressed through the game, I noticed the introduction of more industrial structures. For example, the first area was a wide-open grassy field, followed by a path with rocky structures surrounding it, then finding myself in an area with light poles to light my way through the level, and then an area heavily populated by harmful electrical towers and noticeably lacking in color and wildlife. I came to realize that, while industrialization was a massive convenience to mankind, it also affected the natural state of the world. The liberating feeling I had come to love was suddenly replaced with an anxious, uneasy feeling as I tried to navigate the narrow spaces without sustaining damage to the sparse number of flower petals available to me. It was the first time that I had ever experienced a videogame make me transition from care-free spirit to a cautious player who avoided moving too quickly or too making too many big movements out of fear that I would be hurt by the power lines surrounding me. I should also point out that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flower</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses motion controls to guide the flower petals around (you can change this in the settings, but I found the motion controls more immersive). At some points the motion controls would become aggravating, but it made me feel like nature was fighting back at my control, doing what it wanted rather than following orders from me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flower</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has the player guide the flower petals through a city to reclaim the urban area by covering it in wildlife. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flower</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed me what it felt like to be in a world where change is imminent, and more often than not, there is very little you can do to stop it. You must simply adapt to the changes, and make the best of the situation that you find yourself in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I thoroughly enjoyed playing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flower</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, thatgamecompany’s next installment made me really appreciate the team behind the game. I first encountered </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when a friend of mine told me to download the demo. I downloaded the demo, and as soon as loaded up the game, I immediately fell in love. The music and the atmosphere intrigued my adventurous side, and once I had regained my composure, set off on my adventure. I managed my way up the steep sand dune sitting in front of me, and as soon as I reached the top was greeted with a view of my goal. The mountain with the light emanating from its summit would be my destination. I progressed, sliding down from the sand dune, and making way towards the distant mountain. Soon, I spotted fabric creatures hovering around a point a couple of yards away from me, and decided to investigate. There, I found a strange glowing symbol that turned into a part of my character’s scarf which then granted my character the power of flight! Well, more like short bursts of gliding, but impressive nonetheless. With this newly acquired ability, I was even more curious about the world I would be exploring. I quickly learned that once I had used up my gliding ability, I would need to interact with the fabric creatures in order to use my ability again. This could be done by using the circle button to make a chirping noise, and would result in a very big chirp if the button was held for a little bit. This became especially useful when I encountered an actual person for the first time in the game. I continued to collect the glowing “glyphs” every time I spotted one, thereby increasing the size of my scarf and the amount of time that I was able to glide. I soon encountered an area where I had to use my fully-charged chirp to release a myriad of the fabric creatures from captivity. These creatures then repaid the favor by helping me to cross a gap that was too big for me to cross on my own. The game then had me meditate in front of stone figure that looked similar to my character, and I was then shown details about the world by a large figure clothed in robes similar to mine, but their robes were white instead of the red ones I was wearing. After the figure showed me everything, the giant gate in front of me opened up, and I proceeded into the next area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, I was standing across from what looked like a giant, dilapidated bridge with gaps that were most likely impossible for me to cross without the help of something. Suddenly, a giant fabric section emerged at the base of the broken bridge connecting the first section to the ground near where I was standing. I was immediately perplexed as to what had occurred, when I noticed that there was another figure running around in the distance! I had found someone else, but was unsure if this was an actual person or a very intelligent AI. I approached the figure who was almost identical to my character, however, their robes had a more elaborate design to them. I discovered later that the designs signified how many times the player has completed the story. Soon, I had come to the realization that I had met an actual person, and was genuinely relieved. This person had clearly played the game before, and was now helping me find my way through this strange new world. They showed me where some of the hidden glyphs were in the area, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and even helped me to connect the bridge pieces in order to progress to the next area.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We made our way through the area until we happened upon a facility and saw many creatures that seemed to beg us to release them from their captivity, however, my companion and I were powerless to help them. Fortunately, there were a few creatures that we were able to save once we had climbed to the top of the facility. These creatures then took us to my favorite sequence in the game as thanks for releasing them from captivity. The creatures flew us off into the distance, and soon dropped us off to go sliding through what seemed to be the sand-covered ruins of an ancient civilization. The whole time, the music was fast-paced, and made me feel like I was in the best dream I had ever experienced. The fabric creatures are joyfully floating along with you as you descend through the ruins, and you eventually reach a section where you must release some more fabric creatures in order to ascend a wall to progress. Once you’ve done that, the adrenaline-filled joyride begins again, however, this time you are treated to one of the best views the game has to offer. The camera shifts to focus on the mountain in the background while the player slides across the screen. All the while, the setting sun glistens on the sand which looks absolutely spectacular on both PS3 and PS4. Soon after, I found myself rapidly descending the ruins, the music speeding up until the path ends, and I was left to fall into the darkness of the underside of the ruined city.</span></p>

Image is a screenshot from one of my many playthroughs of <em>Journey</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shocked by the sudden turn of events, my companion (yep, still there) and I hesitantly progressed forward. We progressed our way through the dark underground until we reached a large hall-like area, and encountered a flying stone creature that doesn’t particularly like fabric creatures. For the rest of the underground area, we cautiously progressed, avoiding the spotlight emitted by the stone creature. Having made it through the area without being spotted, we discovered  another shrine that we could meditate at. Afterwards, we continued on into a large chamber with a large tower in the center of the room. By activating the shrines around the room, we made our way to the top of the gargantuan tower. The room became filled with a golden essence that allowed us to glide infinitely as long as we didn’t exit the essence, and multiple varieties of the fabric creatures emerged into the room. We made our way up the tower, and found ourselves at another shrine. This time, the white-robed figure stood alongside us, and recapped our progress up until this point. The figure then showed us what would happen if we continued on our quest to reach the top of the mountain. Although the results seemed grim, we continued on into the harsh icy mountain area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We progressed our way through the icy area, slowly losing our ability to glide due to the cold. My travelling companion and I were able to stave off the cold by huddling together for warmth, but as we climbed higher and higher, we realized how futile it was to try to deny our fate. We progressed until reached a stormy open area, and I knew that this was the final area of our journey. My companion and I huddled together trying to try and maintain as much warmth as we could muster, but the winds picked up and tossed both of us around to the point that we nearly lost each other in the blinding snow. I could barely hear the chirps that my companion was trying to emit, and before I knew it, we were both face down in the snow unable to move. Saddened at the events, I placed my controller down and took a moment to gather my thoughts. It was a few seconds before I realized that both my companion and I were surrounded by four or five white-robed figures, which revived my companion and me. We were given powers to help us reach the top of the mountain! With a push of button, we took flight and soared through the chaos of the snow storm. Stone creatures flew around in the storm attempting to stop us, but we flew past them, eventually emerging into a beautiful, heavenly area. We were able to soar throughout the area, with the accompaniment of orchestral strings to add to the phenomenal situation we found ourselves in. Taking in the atmosphere and the euphoric feeling of having achieved our goal, we landed at the source of the light that was being emitted until our characters faded away into the white light. Once the credits began to roll, tears filled my eyes and I enjoyed the scenes that played before my eyes as the game concluded, only to return me back to the point at which I had begun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I have only played two of thatgamecompany’s games, the experiences they left me with will always remain close to my heart. The idea of joining a random stranger on an adventure together and sharing the experience is incredible. I believe that whatever ideas thatgamecompany decide on for their next game will be just as exciting, and will result in many unique experiences for friends to share. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlOw, Flower,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are available in thatgamecompany’s remastered collection for PS3 and for PS4 as well. If you’re like me and own a PS Vita (hey, let’s be friends!), you can play </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlOw </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flower, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not currently available for the Vita.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On November 22nd, Stephen King and Simon &amp; Schuster Books for Young Readers will <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Charlie-Choo-Choo-world-Dark-Tower/dp/1534401237/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479828348&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=charlie+the+choo+choo">release <em>Charlie the Choo-Choo</em></a> by Beryl Evans. The book, based on the fictional children&#8217;s book by the fictional Evans comes straight out <em>The Dark Tower</em> series by Stephen King. Here are the details from Simon &amp; Schuster:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fans of Stephen King’s <em>The Dark Tower</em> will definitely want this picture book about a train engine and his devoted engineer.</p>
<p>Engineer Bob has a secret: His train engine, Charlie the Choo-Choo, is alive…and also his best friend. From celebrated author Beryl Evans and illustrator Ned Dameron comes a story about friendship, loyalty, and hard work.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_42057" style="width: 465px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-42057 " src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/stephenkingandcharlie.jpg" alt="and be a happy choo-choo train, until the day I die." width="455" height="607" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/stephenkingandcharlie.jpg 612w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/stephenkingandcharlie-225x300.jpg 225w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/stephenkingandcharlie-298x397.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo from @StephenKing on Twitter</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite her non-existence, Beryl Evans did appear <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/22/charlie-choo-choo-stephen-king-dark-tower-comic-con">at this year&#8217;s San Diego Comic-Con</a> to sign copies of the book. <strong>Spoilers inbound.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Readers of King&#8217;s T<em>he Dark Tower</em> series will recognize Charlie the Choo-Choo as the children&#8217;s book Jake Chambers, a major character in the series, purchased in the third Dark Tower book, <em>The Wastelands</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_42064" style="width: 493px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-42064" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/artworx_ss_037.jpg" alt="Don't ask him silly questions, he won't play silly games." width="483" height="710" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/artworx_ss_037.jpg 545w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/artworx_ss_037-204x300.jpg 204w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/artworx_ss_037-298x437.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Wastelands by Stephen King.</p></div>
<p>In <em>The Wastelands</em>, Jake gets &#8220;a deep chill despite Charlie&#8217;s smile&#8221; because the train &#8220;had clearly human features.&#8221; Despite the &#8220;rather heavy-handed cuteness of the story&#8221;, Jake Chambers &#8220;didn&#8217;t trust that smile&#8221; due to the illustrations of Charlie suffering from the uncanny valley, the feeling of uneasiness we get when robots, machines, and 3d renderings appear human but not human enough. King does a masterful job of creeping out his readers, even with something as simple as a character in his novel reading a children&#8217;s books.</p>
<p>We know as readers that despite &#8220;Engineer Bob look[ing] like he had lost his last friend&#8221; and &#8220;there [are] a lot of stories for kids with stuff like this in them&#8221; &#8211; something is off about this children&#8217;s book because Jake &#8220;was not saddened by Charlie&#8217;s relegation to the weedy wastelands&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Good, he thought. That&#8217;s the place for him. That&#8217;s the place, because he&#8217;s dangerous. Let him rot there, and don&#8217;t trust that tear in his eye &#8211; they say crocodiles cry, too&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the end, Charlie and Engineer Bob get jobs pulling kids around an amusement park but Jake is not falling for the happy ending for one minute. Though &#8220;Engineer Bob&#8217;s smile was supposed to convey supreme happiness&#8221; in the engine cab of Charlie &#8220;looking as happy as a pig in shit,&#8221; to Jake &#8220;it looked like the grin of a lunatic.&#8221; A look that Charlie shares and the children riding in his passenger cars do not. Their faces, according to Jake, &#8220;looked like grimaces of terror&#8221; saying &#8220;let us off this train&#8221; and &#8220;please, just let us off this train alive.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_42062" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-42062 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wastelands_6_choo_choo.jpg" alt="He didn't trust that smile." width="600" height="452" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wastelands_6_choo_choo.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wastelands_6_choo_choo-300x226.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wastelands_6_choo_choo-298x224.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image by Ned Dameron from The Wastelands.</p></div>
<p>The book would later serve as foreshadowing for the monorail known as Blaine that would get Roland and company out the city of Lud and inspire Eddie Dean to defeat the insanely suicidal engine. <strong>Spoilers outbound.</strong></p>
<p>The fact that King has decided to bring the fictional <em>Charlie The Choo-Choo</em> book to life could be because of the upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_(2017_film)">film</a> based on <em>The Dark Tower</em> series starring Idris Alba, Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Taylor. Let&#8217;s hope if <em>The Stand</em> adaptation ever gets off the ground, he&#8217;ll keep Captain Trips, the superflu that kills 99.4% of the population, to himself.</p>

The first is a letter dated 1783, chronicling the winning of a competition, and existence of something called &#8220;House Marewick&#8221;. After a quick perusal, many of the documents are related to this tournament and other Geekly factions. The transcription will follow, along with a scan of the original documents.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I write to you with the greatest excitement this third day of September in the year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, having just completed the voyage home from GeeklyCon Budapest. </span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was saddened to hear that you had fallen ill, as I was looking forward to attending GeeklyCon with you after your many tales of previous exploits and the great merriment you had experienced. </span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was quite a relief when I was selected for House Marewick; I was hoping we would become brothers in house and would compete in the tournament side by side. I know it is silly to think, but when I heard you couldn’t make it, I had hoped that you would have written to the selection committee from your convalescent bed to put in a good word for me. It is now my understanding that you aren’t selected by some mortal man, but it is by the very essence of your soul that you are judged and sorted.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enough preamble, on to my tale! It was an amazing weekend as you prognosticated, and who would take home the banner came down to our own House Marewick, and a dark-hearted sect who I shall not mention by name. I, myself was chosen as house champion for the final task, and after holding mine breath for 4 and 200 seconds, I was deemed victor, bringing home the banner for the entire house! That night, the revelry reached heights I had not imagined, and woe was my head on the next morn. </span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brief day’s pain was all worth it, considering the great joy it brought me. I feel like I have become part of history and done something greater than myself. Please write back with tidings of better health, for it would be unjust for us to not attend the next GeeklyCon as brothers in house.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yours always,</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chester</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">P.s. Rumour has is the next year GeeklyCon will be held in Amsterdam!</span></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/821/538/46f9827724f8763844e4518c2b036ba9_original.png?w=1536&amp;h=864&amp;fit=fill&amp;bg=000000&amp;v=1477392479&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=170feec143ca604a9f5b9cdb77d992e9" alt="Well, this is a thing" width="1152" height="648" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do butts, unicorns, and tingling have to do with one another? Probably nothing, they’re just a few awesome words I threw together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh? You thought I was going to talk about the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/703752115/kickstarted-in-the-butt-a-chuck-tingle-digital-adv">Kickstarter for the Chuck Tingle Digital Adventure game</a> (title currently WIP)? If that’s what you truly want, we can do that, fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My first experience with Chuck Tingle was when on the Jimquisition, Laura K. Dale brought up that someone on Amazon had very appropriately stepped into her branding zone of “butts” and had decided to write a book named “Pounded in the Butt by my Butt.” Surely this physical impossibility, and dilemma would make for one downright atrocious book. It did, it was, and it was a beautiful trash fire that burns with the intensity of a thousand suns. Well, as in so far as the internet loved it. Soon after, Alex Cater came on Good Looks Bad Books (shameless plug), and reviewed a sequel to the book, “Pounded in the Butt by my Butt.”, apparently a third in a trilogy of books that was named, and get ready for this, “Pounded in The Butt By My Book “Pounded In The Butt By My Book’ Pounded In the Butt By My Own Butt’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this, Chuck Tingle started to frequently appear in more places, on one of the RoosterTeeth podcasts when they actually read a few lines of “Pokebutt Go: Pounded By ‘Em All” after the epidemic we now know as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pokemon Go</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even the Senior Editor of Drunks and Dragons here on GeeklyInc, the one and only Steph Kingston, came on to GLBB, read and reviewed that same book. At this point, I could have written my own book called, “Pounded in the Ear by Chuck Tingle’s ‘Pounded In the Butt’”. I was literally taking a pounding. </span></p>
<div style="width: 323px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/27/1e/8d/271e8d4227adefe42cc7738ae2366eef.jpg" alt="No, but seriously, about damn time he got an Oscar. Just had to be mauled by a bear." width="313" height="500" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>He deserved it. Getting pounded in the butt that is&#8230;</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Tingle’s genre spreads itself wide, from “Space Raptor Butt Invasion” to things such as “Angry Man Pounded By The Fear OF His Latent Gayness Over A Dinosaur Transitioning Into a Unicorn.” Before we continue, I’m going to head you off at the pass here. Yes, these books are ridiculously titled and the interior is just as bad in terms of content, but these are some of the more decent books. Despite dealing with these hilariously absurd topics, they only skim the line of pornographic while giving the reader a good romp through comedic gold garbage. It has been said, “you can’t polish a turd”. So, my rebuttal is, why are you touching a turd while instead you could simply just laugh at it? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have given Chuck Tingle a good rimming, what about this <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/703752115/kickstarted-in-the-butt-a-chuck-tingle-digital-adv">Kickstarter</a>? Well, due to Chuck Tingle’s popularity, it would obviously garner some attention from other places. Where there is garbage, there are sure to be flies that follow. Also, before we continue any further, let me explain the garbage analogy. Do not misunderstand, I mean no offense, this is simply how this portion of the smut field operates. It also gives me an excuse to write the word analogy, bringing in more trash to this fire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to the Kickstarter, Zoe Quinn (<em>Depression Quest, Framed, Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow’s Walk</em>) had reached out to Dr. Tingle (yes apparently he has a PHD in Sensual Massage) in order to propose to him a game in a similar vein to his books. His response, “Yes, thank you, what is game?” After a few moments, Chuck then started to unload his ideas onto Twitter and eventually in Zoe’s DMs. Truly, Dr. Tingle is a thing of unbarred enthusiasm for his branding.</span></p>
<div style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium" src="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/252/750/c18a3d44c7aec2169d87ad43ed8a4c6e_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1477391777&amp;q=92&amp;s=4791ce7b970599fe361cf7a826309398" alt="For no particular reason..." width="680" height="621" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>I think we all need a game about proving love right now. </em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Vice’s documentary on the subject, Zoe Quinn has taken this project and started to run with it. Since it is relation to Dr. Tingle’s work, the game first and foremost is described as a dating sim, with the goal of “proving love”, a very prominent goal in a majority of Dr. Tingle’s books. The dating sim genre as of late has been rather prominent, with games such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hatoful Boyfriend</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">HuniePop</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panzermadels: Tank Dating Simulator.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yeah, don&#8217;t ask about that last one&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the antithesis of the popular genre is the type of animation that Quinn wants to implement. They want to use Full Motion Video, or a technique that uses pre-recorded video files instead of things likes sprites and 3D models. And by they want to, they already have begun. After looking into the process of development of the game, it&#8217;s noted that they started work on this process before the Kickstarter had even begun, doing something most Kickstarters don&#8217;t do, have previous work put into the project. Using Full Motion Video (FMV) is a very expensive process, and while seemingly “easier”, has a lot of nuance to it. However, they refer to FMV as a “long-abandoned” technique, when this is mostly untrue. Several games during the past few years have used FMV to great effect. Games like “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her Story</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” had a major impact on the players experience, using the video as a basis of suspicions, clues, and gave a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more flexible game experience. <em>Her Story </em>had no official ending, the game was complete when you <strong>felt</strong> like it was complete, just like you felt that certain things or ways the actor said something felt like clues in the game. Another game that uses FMV to great effect is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contradiction: Spot the Liar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The game has been described as in the same vein as Clue, the board game, but with the skillful twist of story, using such a limiting animation technique. However, something like Full Motion Video can help improve, especially when you are trying to find the subtle hints in social interactions when trying to &#8220;spot the liar&#8221;. If used correctly, Quinn can use Full Motion Video to great effect, creating a unique style and top notch hilarity. In the end, the FMV technique fits in very well with Dr. Tingle’s book covers and that odd style of writing of his. </span></p>
<div style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="http://www.herstorygame.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Her-Story-Screenshot-Desktop-B.jpg" alt="Please play this game. " width="990" height="619" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Her Story</em> used Full Motion Video to great effect. <em>Her Story</em> was brilliant in concept and in execution.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of writing, one of my concerns was if Dr. Tingle would be writing this story himself. From what the Kickstarter has revealed, while he may not be directly writing the story, he is providing both content and ideas constantly to the project, giving over notes to Quinn through DM’s. Even without Dr. Tingle as the writer, Quinn has proved in the past with her previous games, like “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depression Quest</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. While the “tingler” project doesn’t deal with such serious topics, there is always a subtle tone to Dr.Tingle’s writing that promotes thinking beyond just what the writing is directly saying. After all, most works are simply parodies of current trends and topics, even if they are just simply being pounded in the butt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a multitude of reasons why this project is, to use that bland word, interesting. A parody smut writer, a controversial games developer, and a medium that isn’t always serious. Quinn had said herself in response to “what is game?”, she responded, “it’s like art but worse but also good…” That seems to be prevalent throughout this entire campaign, in this entire genre. It’s like art, but trash, but also good. The goal, another combination of references, $69,420, is still explained in more detail lower in the kickstarter, that the goal is $70,000, but could survive if it’s only a few hundred away. The pledge levels themselves, are more references like $69, $169, $269, $420 and so on. I was at first very concerned about this, thinking maybe they would not take the campaign seriously in the long run. However, seeing the progress so far, seeing the previous work, I don’t doubt that the follow through on the project. Even after the project is complete, it will be available for free as well, so I don&#8217;t think many will skeptical if it was made simply for profit. I think now, more than ever, we all need a True Buckaroo to kiss, and maybe prove that love is real. A good laugh and smile is what we need, and I think this will be able to provide the good pounding that we need. I look forward to playing this game, as insane as it is, with GLBB, with my friends, and cackling about how absurd it is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the engorgement of support in the last few days of the campaign, it’s not surprising that even more people than ever want to see some Buckaroo’s kiss and makeup. Just about 4 days before the campaign ended, I had checked on it to see that they were still a few thousand behind, which can be a warning sign for a failing campaign. After checking on it again after it has ended, the backers have certainly rear-ended this one, smashing it past to $85,448. The rush near the end of Kickstarter’s is always surprising, but after what’s been going on as of late, this might be a good glamour shot for us in the future. Innuendos aside, I look forward to this early next year in 2017. I also look forward to covering it again once it’s out, because good lord do those characters look like they need to be covered.</span></p>
<div style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium" src="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/265/002/5bcd0eed40623cf289fc27d9836f7919_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1477454271&amp;q=92&amp;s=849c09e0e0d1f049018e9d0bd61aa68a" alt="Miss you Harambe - Dammit Will" width="680" height="621" /><p class="wp-caption-text">We all had a gorilla touch our hearts this year, we can at least pound it back.</p></div>
<p>If you want to keep track of the project, I would say follow Zoe Quinn on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/unburntwitch?lang=en">@UnburntWitch</a>, and you can find even more from her at <a href="http://unburntwitch.com">unburntwitch.com</a>. I would also, if you have the time, go play <em>Depression Quest</em>, because it&#8217;s free on Steam and it&#8217;s a decent read. As for the big doctor himself, you can find him on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/ChuckTingle?lang=en">@ChuckTingle</a>, and just take a look through Amazon’s book section, you’ll ram into him at some point I’m sure.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s finally time for Wine, Women &amp; Westeros 6, Part 2: 2 Queen 2 Furious! You may have noticed that there was quite a break in between Part 1 and Part 2&#8230;you may have also noticed that there is occasionally a bit of an echo in the audio&#8230;oddly enough, these things are related! I like to carry on the fine tradition of screwing up our audio every time we record one of these dang episodes, just to keep you all on your toes. I hope the wait just makes the very relevant Shrek the Third references contained within even sweeter to your thirsty ears.</p>
<p>Also! This episode was recorded before the election&#8230;we were such sweet summer children then.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It happened! Acadecon happened and it was amazing! This year I decided to expand my experience by running three games over three different systems. Building off my previous article, I wanted focus on giving a bit more information on the preparation that led to the eventual running of the games, and of course, how I feel all of that went. Let’s start with the running of the games shall we? No? Nah, you’re right, let’s keep it linear and start with the prep-steps.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-42040 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0410-225x300.jpg" alt="img_0410" width="285" height="380" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0410-225x300.jpg 225w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0410-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0410-900x1200.jpg 900w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0410-298x397.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0410-620x827.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0410.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></p>
<p>Game prep! The adventures I used were of my own design… well, they were inspired by each settings own material I should say, but I would like to point out that there was NO REASON for me to have done that. There are plenty of great adventures out there that I could have used. I was trying to challenge myself, so I was going to live, or die, by that choice. I’ll focus on <em>7th Sea</em> as that seems to be defining my approach to GMing lately. This was the only game that I made my own pre-generated characters for. My intention was to create characters for the adventure that embodied a little something from as much of the character creation options that I could. In focusing so much on trying to give a broad range to choose from, in the end, I think I may have limited a couple of the characters. <em>7th Sea’s</em> game mechanics approaches social interaction and physical combat pretty much the same way. I dipped into that a little in the previous article (declare approach, produce raises, spend raises to change scene), so I tried to make certain characters stronger with social interaction and others stronger in the physical interactions.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-42039 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FullSizeRender.jpg" alt="fullsizerender" width="620" height="355" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FullSizeRender.jpg 1180w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FullSizeRender-300x172.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FullSizeRender-768x439.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FullSizeRender-298x170.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FullSizeRender-620x355.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>What I believe I neglected to consider was that the adventure I wrote sort of slanted toward physical combat more often than not. So here’s a lesson that I’m sure many of you know, but just in case there is anyone like me out there, listen well! When you&#8217;re making original characters for an adventure you have written, make sure you take the tone and direction of action into account when you make the characters. There should be some purpose behind the characters abilities based on what they are most likely to encounter. I’m not saying make a party of soldiers if it’s a combat heavy game, but maybe give the negotiator type character a few more ranks in that weaponry skill so they are not sitting there with 2 raises in the final boss battle. So I set out my materials, took a deep breath, and then these beautiful people sat down at my table. You might recognize one&#8230;or two&#8230;or ALL of the players; which was thrilling and frightening to me. After a quick little spiel about the setting and the basic walkthrough of the rules, we were set to begin!</p>

<p>Like many of us, or most of us, I would love to be struck with pure inspiration and be able to write a novel or something worthy of public consumption. For now, though, I’ve found it pretty satisfying to write short little adventures for roleplaying games. Just little stories that follow a general flow that is dictated by the players’ actions that then have to be put into perspective relative to the adventure. I found something addicting about this process at Acadecon. It came out almost immediately in the <em>7th Sea</em> game. With convention games you probably want to get straight to the meat of why you all are there at the table &#8211; to tell an exciting story. Right off the bat these beautiful players started interacting with the world; asking questions and wanting to speak with the NPCs that I placed in front of them. Something that became evident to me was that when players get the idea that they can affect the world around them and the world will push back and react, they almost always seem to want more and to continue to push and prod at the story until something cool emerges-which is GREAT! As GMs, it’s sort of our responsibility to facilitate and most importantly ENCOURAGE this behavior through our own role play of the world around them. This was a big realization for me, and whether or not I pulled it off as well as I would have liked, I think everyone had a good time. This, in my opinion, and especially at a convention is the most important thing and actually brings me to a point for the players out there. You paid money to go to a con, then signed up to commit your time to a game you wanted to play in. Have fun, dig into the adventure, and challenge the GM in turn to bring his or her story to life. My games all ended with different outcomes than I expected and I embraced every second of it. Why? Because the players brought us there with their immersed role play, so put the conductor hat-thing down and just let it flow.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I guess it can be total honesty time now. I am well aware that I leave a lot to be desired as a well rounded GM, but one thing I try harder at than anything else is to keep things moving. I try to make rulings for each situation and not to look up rules at the table. Most of the players I ran for at Acadecon were unfamiliar with the games I was running and I loved that. I love introducing people to the games I enjoy playing as well as GMing. I try to bring that enthusiasm with me and give the players something to chew on roleplay wise. To accomplish this I try to make my NPCs as memorable as possible. I try to give them quirks with my own body language. I stand up when I GM so it’s easier, but try and do something the players can latch onto and draw them into the scenes. Look, I’m not that great at any of this, but I learned in those three games that my attempts at achieving steady story momentum combined with NPCs bringing the setting and scenes to life, go farther to produce a memorable experience then trying to make sure I was following all the rules the whole time. My always humble opinion is that if a con game should be anything, it should be memorable and exciting. I’d like to think that I took a big step in that direction at Acadecon 2016. As always, I’m willing to go deeper into this experience if anyone is interested or curious. Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>First things first: No, this is not a review of <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>, you filthy smut-puppets. If you are looking for something to rustle your jimmies, search elsewhere. Today, we are going to be taking a look at a wildly imaginative dystopian novel bearing a similar name by superstar author Jasper Fforde.</p>
<p>In the future, color is everything. Humanity has changed and now, different shades are used for everything from medicine to narcotics; relics from civilizations past are unearthed and harvested to supply the world with paint. Your place in life, your profession, and your relationships with those around you are defined by the color that you can see. As if this weren’t strange enough, a backwards and bureaucratic government enforces an inane set of rules: technology is limited, knowledge is neglected, and civic duty is honored above all else, establishing the perfect environment for a society of stasis.</p>
<p>The story follows Edward Russet, a relatively mild-mannered citizen of this strange “Colortocracy”. Through a bout of ill luck, Eddie winds up on a trip to the Outer Fringes of Chromatacia, away from his mundane life and rapidly approaching marriage, and into the midst of a mystery that will change everything he knows about the world he lives in. Eddie encounters a colorful cast of characters, including a jam-crazed nudist, an overly zealous librarian, and a spunky but violent love interest who enjoys defying authority a bit too much.</p>
<p>In <em>Shades of Grey</em>, Jasper Fforde depicts an incredibly British dystopia, marked by a polite deference to the rules, a respect for queues, and a surrender of individual worth for a strict intrinsic class system. It is a stark contrast to the post-apocalyptic tendencies in most modern fiction. While <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <em>Mad Max</em> may have an edge on the gritty violence front, <em>Shades of Grey</em> offers something refreshingly different to the traditional genre stereotypes. Fforde essentially ignores all the questions you want to ask about his world (What happened that wiped out our civilization? How did humans lose the ability to see color? What is the government doing?) and in turn, peers into the mysteries that matter to the characters.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say <em>Shades of Grey</em> doesn’t touch on the themes that make dystopian novels so satisfyingly dark. There are echoes of Big Brother in how the chromatic society handles its laws, and the destruction of knowledge and technology is evident throughout. Despite the cleverness and inquisitiveness of Fforde’s main character, his society as a whole is clearly moving towards a soma-esque complacency and acceptance of clear institutionalized racism.</p>
<p>Yet for all that, <em>Shades of Grey</em> is a light-hearted take on the end of the world as we know it; as rife with absurdity as it is with danger and darkness. The novel doesn’t take its murder and mystery too seriously&#8211;bits of slapstick humour and clever dialogue abound. Much of the story is just an exploration of the oddments and quirks of Fforde’s eclectic world, and it is this peek into a truly foreign land where the book really shines. Reading <em>Shades of Grey</em> feels like a perpetual inside joke between you and the author; a humor that immediately emerges and demands that you keep turning the page. The story may lack some of the gritty political/emotional punches of its dystopian older siblings (<em>1984</em>, <em>Brave New World</em>, <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>) but it more than makes up for this with levity and wit.</p>
<p><em>Shades of Grey</em> by Jasper Fforde is available on <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Shades-Grey-Novel-Jasper-Fforde/dp/0143118587/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479742636&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=shades+of+gray">Amazon</a> or at your local bookstore.</p>

<p>Ok, so maybe the killer normally doesn’t have feathers. But you get the trope.</p>
<p><em>Thankskilling </em>may be the horror comedy nobody asked for, but its mix of gore, adult humor, and unapologetic silliness hits just the right nerve, straddling the line between awful and awesome in a way that the producers of <em>Sharknado </em>dream they could do.</p>

<p>The story begins with, well, breasts. In what one character recounts as “the most notorious moment in pilgrim history,” American settlers dishonored a poorly animated Native American, who in a vengeful rage necromanced a turkey to wreak havoc. Or, at least, we’re meant to assume he did, as the only death we see is that of  a well-endowed woman running around with her shirt half open &#8211; as pilgrims were apt to do in those days.</p>
<p>The world’s leading Turkeyologists &#8211; another priceless quote among many &#8211; say legend has it the beast will roam the world every 505 years and kill the first humans it encounters. His rest is cut short, however, by a dog who has the misfortune to pee on an ancient Native American artifact (spoiler alert: the dog dies).</p>
<p>Turkie &#8211; the foul-mouthed &#8211; emerges pissed, itching to crack skulls and puns that would give Freddy Krueger a run for his money.</p>
<p>A few gems:<br />
“I’m going to drink your blood like cranberry sauce!”<br />
“You just got stuffed.”<br />
“Gobble gobble motherfuckers!”</p>

<p>Armed with the tools that have oppressed his kind for ages &#8211; meat thermometers, turkey carvers, guns &#8211; he hunts down the teens as they struggle to act amid uncomfortably close headshots and lighting so glaringly bad on certain actors, you wonder if the technicians had vendettas against them.</p>
<p>Directors Jordan Downey and Kevin Stewart shot the film during the summer before their senior year of college with a budget of $3,500. Downey was behind the voice and creation of the foul-mouthed puppet, according to an interview with ihorror.com. He frankenstein-d the puppet from a hunting decoy and leftover clay and latex from another student project.</p>
<p>The two have said themed horror comedies like <em>Leprechaun </em>and <em>Jack Frost</em> inspired <em>Thankskilling</em>. It aims to be nothing more than a B-movie, and wears its silliness unapologetically. In his search for one of the teens, Turkie dons glasses and fake eyebrows to get invited into her father’s home. Assuming he’s a little person, the father makes them coffee and spouts off a few tone-deaf remarks about his stature. The awkward moment is cut short when the dad goes a step too far; nobody calls Turkie a strange duck.</p>
<p>When the teenagers arrive, the Turkie has a new disguise: the father’s face, a la “Silence of the Lamb.” And the teens are just as clueless.</p>
<p><em>Thankskilling</em> features original songs, such as the borderline love ballad between the comic relief and nerd archetypes, and the synthe theme that follows Turkie through his murderous romp.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-42093 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Thankskilling-3-Cover-211x300.jpg" alt="thankskilling-3-cover" width="527" height="749" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Thankskilling-3-Cover-211x300.jpg 211w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Thankskilling-3-Cover-768x1090.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Thankskilling-3-Cover-846x1200.jpg 846w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Thankskilling-3-Cover-298x423.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Thankskilling-3-Cover-620x880.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Thankskilling-3-Cover.jpg 1057w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></p>
<p>The film gained cult status and inspired a sequel, <em>Thankskilling 3</em> &#8211; yes you read that right &#8211; that raised over $100,000 on Kickstarter. The plot, just as nonsensical as its predecessor, follows Turkie, enraged after learning that the last copy of <em>Thankskilling 2</em> has been chucked into the garbage, on a quest to find the DVD as it holds the key to the destruction of the human race. Aliens become involved. As does a rapping grandmother.</p>
<p>And just when you think you’ve hit the end of the weirdness that is <em>Thankskilling</em>, you find its creators inspired an Ouroboros of bad with their summer project. Because <em>Thankskilling &#8211; The Musical</em> is a very real thing. Inspired by all the cliche and B-movie glory that is the original.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-42092 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TK_Musical_TitleWEB-300x150.png" alt="tk_musical_titleweb" width="710" height="355" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TK_Musical_TitleWEB-300x150.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TK_Musical_TitleWEB-768x384.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TK_Musical_TitleWEB-298x149.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TK_Musical_TitleWEB-620x310.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TK_Musical_TitleWEB.png 995w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<p>So this Thursday, curl up and learn about what we should really be thankful for this holiday season: friends and family. Even if the characters of <em>Thankskilling </em>forget both very shortly after they die. <em>Thankskilling</em> is available for download on iTunes and Amazon for a whopping $2.99. Its sequel is free on most digital platforms.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a very long week of being a busy adult, I got to sit back in an IMAX with the largest bag of popcorn ever and a water bottle that I had smuggled into the theatre in an inauspiciously large cat lady purse. From the opening score to the very last credit, I ascended to the silver screen abyss &#8211; I felt just like the same gawky eleven year old that asked her mom if she could stay in her seat and watch Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone one more time.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-42026 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fantastic-beasts-cast-xlarge-300x169.jpg" alt="fantastic-beasts-cast-xlarge" width="734" height="413" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fantastic-beasts-cast-xlarge-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fantastic-beasts-cast-xlarge-768x433.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fantastic-beasts-cast-xlarge-1200x676.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fantastic-beasts-cast-xlarge-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fantastic-beasts-cast-xlarge-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fantastic-beasts-cast-xlarge.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px" /></p>
<p><em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em> follows a young Newt Scamander on an impromptu adventure in the magical world of prohibition-era New York. We get to ride along with a mostly new cast of characters through the city and finally meet some amazing magical creatures that Potterheads have thus far only been able to read about.  This movie has everything you could ever need: there&#8217;s snifflers, central park, ex-aurors, a suitcase I wish I owned, and some sweet, sweet wand work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a story that only J.K. Rowling could tell, brought to life by the same team that was able to capture her magic on film the first time. If you&#8217;re a fan like me, there&#8217;s no way you&#8217;ll only be able to see it once!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guess what is just around the corner? The Winter Solstice! Or Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Christmas, or whatever holiday you may celebrate this time of year. Don’t groan. Thanksgiving is next week. The holidays will be here before you know it!</p>
<p>Readers are notoriously hard to shop for. If you’re anything like my family, you struggle with what to get the reader, or readers, in the family or among your friends. Maybe you usually get them a gift card to Barnes and Noble. A gift card is great, but gift cards can feel impersonal and you may be wanting to actually give <i>something. </i>If that’s you, then you’re in luck! I’m here to help provide you with suggestions for great books or reading related items to give as gifts this year (or maybe to get for yourself with that gift card you’re going to get).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter " src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1468242094l/30987875.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="827" /></p>
<p><em>A Game of Thrones: Illustrated Edition</em> by George R.R. Martin is an excellent choice for fans of this series, even if they already own a copy of this book. Most especially if they are a fan of our podcast <em>Cast of Thrones</em>! I saw this beauty is Barnes and Noble the other day and I flipped through its gorgeous pages. The illustrations in this book are amazing. Depending on where you decided to purchase this, it can be a bit spendy. It sells for about $50 full price, but if you look around on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Illustrated-Song-Fire/dp/0553808044/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479482627&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=A+Game+of+Thrones%3A+Illustrated+Edition&amp;tag=geek0e7-20">Amazon </a>or Barnes &amp; Noble, you can find it for about $30.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter " src="http://www.peterpauper.com/dealer/images/big_images/9781441304827.jpg" alt="" width="554" height="857" /></p>
<p>The Book Lover’s Journal would be a cool gift for readers that like to keep track of their books, who they have lended their books to, and jot down notes on what they are currently reading. You can find this handy notebook on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Lovers-Journal-Reading-Organizer/dp/1441304827/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479482667&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Book+Lover%E2%80%99s+Journal&amp;tag=geek0e7-20">Amazon </a>for about $13.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter " src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1459371062l/29241319.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="573" /></p>
<p>Continuing in a similar, more family-friendly direction is <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: The Illustrated Edition</em>. This would definitely be perfect for Harry Potter fans (obviously), especially if they already own the illustrated edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. If they don’t, maybe get that one, or both! Also perfect for fan of the Yer a Wizard, Harry podcast. The art, done by Jim Kay, is just perfect and it makes re-reading the series just that much more enjoyable. Not as pricey as the Game of Thrones illustrated edition; about $24 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Chamber-Secrets-Illustrated/dp/0545791324/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479482719&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Harry+Potter+and+the+Chamber+of+Secrets+illustrated+edition&amp;tag=geek0e7-20">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>My next suggestion isn’t so much a thing as it is a place to find the things. Especially the things that are literary themed or themed around a specific fandom. That place is on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>. You can find almost anything there and also support individual artists. Take this candle for example:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter " src="https://img1.etsystatic.com/043/0/5532178/il_570xN.590150157_1mm7.jpg" alt="" width="570" height="790" /></p>
<p>This candle, while a little spendy at $39, is amazing! This is a Spawn of Cthulhu candle sold by <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/MonstersDomesticated?ref=l2-shopheader-name">MonstersDomesticed</a>. (Obviously for fans of Cthulhu and Friends.) This is just one awesome example of the types of things you can find on Etsy. Think of any fandom out there, you are probably able to find all sorts of goodies, including jewelry, candles, art, bookmarks, &amp; clothing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter " src="http://piccadillyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Alice-Cover.png" alt="" width="550" height="550" /></p>
<p>Does your family member or friend like to color? With the trend of adult coloring books, there are plenty of options out there that are inspired by books. <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, <em>Outlander</em>, <em>Harry Potter</em>, <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, and plenty more. If you know they love Jane Austen, there are coloring books out there! The best part is that they aren’t very expensive, usually somewhere between $10 to $20.</p>

<p>This next suggestion is going to require that you know a little about what your reader’s book collection. If there is a specific book classic that you know your reader loves and they collect different editions, another edition of that book would be a great idea! I collect editions of two of my favorite classics, <em>Jane Eyre</em> and <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. So if you know that they don’t have a specific edition, seek it out!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter " src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1469408283l/30556352.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="780" /></p>
<p>Is your reader also a gamer? Maybe something like <em>Drunks &amp; Dragons</em>, I mean <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>? Find an awesome book related to the game they love. Maybe something like <em>Volo’s Guide to Monsters</em>, which delves into the lore around monsters and new playable races in the fifth edition of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Or maybe they like <em>Halo</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, or <em>Eve Online</em>. There are both stories and practical guides that you can find regarding most popular games.</p>
<p>Whatever you get your loved one this holiday season, it is always the thought that counts. But also remember that family and friends are more important than the gifts.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;You are of the Pantheon. You will be loved. You will be hated. You will be brilliant. Within two years, you will be dead.”</em></p>
<p>Human history is rife with tales of gods and their miraculous deeds, from the sultry Aphrodite to the wise Odin, every culture that has popped up on this big blue marble has chanted their gods names and whispered their stories to their children. However, these ancient myths are still kicking even in the twenty-first century, with such notable examples as the revival of Marvel’s take on the Norse god Thor in the Avenger’s series. Let’s keep this worship train rolling and take a look at an intriguing new take on the myths of old. Today, we’re answering the question: Should You Read: <em>The Wicked + The Divine</em>?</p>
<p>The premise is relatively straightforward: every ninety years, a pantheon of twelve gods are reincarnated into the bodies of unsuspecting humans through an event known as the Recurrence. From there, they are given two years to accomplish a single task: to inspire the people of the world in whatever ways they can. After their two years are up, they die. Naturally, due to their stints of godhood being so short, each Pantheon tends to assume roles that are particularly influential for a given generation in order to best inspire the masses. What could possibly be more inspiring for the mortals of 2014 than for their gods to resemble the dazzling, enigmatic star studded pop stars we all worship and despise?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41903" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wicked-divine-3-full.jpg" alt="GeeklyInc Review - Wicked + Divine Panels" width="600" height="244" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wicked-divine-3-full.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wicked-divine-3-full-300x122.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wicked-divine-3-full-298x121.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The story follows Laura, a rebellious eighteen year-old from London who is ordinary in every sense of the word; she fails to be understood by her parents, struggles to forge her own identity and, more than anything, she wants to be special. As a fervent super-fan of the newest Pantheon, Laura wishes for nothing more from her dull life than to rejoice in their presence, intoxicated by their inspiring messages.</p>
<p>After a chance meeting with Lucifer herself (or, Luci, as she prefers), Laura is inadvertently thrust into a world of supernatural drama and politics that she is ill-equipped to handle. As the mortal companion, or plaything for some, Laura is the outsider looking in. While she becomes actively involved in the affairs of the Pantheon, it never truly feels like she holds any sway over their actions. She offers a very human perspective into the chaotic world of the newly ordained gods.</p>
<p>Laura’s devotion to the Pantheon also serves as an example of how pop stars are glorified in modern society and the danger of blurring the line between passionate fandom and religious worship. This point is further driven home by having the Pantheon aesthetically resemble several larger-than-life real-world personalities that most readers are likely to recognize (e.g. Kanye West, Rihanna, David Bowie, etc.), making these over the top characters seem familiar and real.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41902" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wicked-divine-1-full.jpg" alt="GeeklyInc Review - Wicked + Divine Panels" width="676" height="238" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wicked-divine-1-full.jpg 676w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wicked-divine-1-full-300x106.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wicked-divine-1-full-298x105.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wicked-divine-1-full-620x218.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /></p>
<p>Each member of the Pantheon has their own unique message to share when it comes to accomplishing their overall goal to “inspire” the masses. We are frequently reminded that while the stars are literal gods, they are still very human and they behave as such: petty revenge on a jealous ex-lover, struggling for their art to be understood, and coming to terms with their very un-godlike mortality reveals the true nature behind the godly personas that have been built up in the public eye. In these vulnerable scenes, the gods themselves feel like real people one can relate to, after all it was not long ago that they were indeed human. Yes, they’re gods, but they are tormented by their divine status and need to be desired by all. What else is the purpose of a god than to be worshiped? If not, then what is the need for a god?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41904" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wicket-divine-2-full.jpg" alt="GeeklyInc Review - Wicked + Divine Panels" width="350" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wicket-divine-2-full.jpg 350w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wicket-divine-2-full-300x171.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wicket-divine-2-full-298x170.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></p>
<p>So, the question is: Should You Read: <em>The Wicked + The Divine</em>? From sex scandals and drug addiction to infighting and murder, many of the events that take place are reminiscent of real-world celebrity tabloid headlines that draw us in and leave us wanting more. <em>The Wicked + The Divine</em> is a new take on old classics, if we may call religious figures “classics”, but provides an intriguing insight into the society we live in today. These gods are fresh, fabulous, and fucked up. Get on your knees and worship. This one is worth the read.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="http://www.wsusignpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_0150.jpg" alt="" width="3264" height="2448" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been playing tabletop RPGs (TTRPGs) for a little over four years. In the time since, I have been asked by many hypothetical people, “Eli, Dungeons and Dragons sounds really interesting, but I just don’t know how to get into it. Any advice?” Well, good news, everyone! I am here to answer all of your RPG questions. I’ll try to keep this as system neutral as possible, but for every specific example I may have to give, I will be defaulting to <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, as I have the most experience with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let’s talk about why play TTRPGs. Matt Colville has some great videos on </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ama2wMxq84o" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">why he plays D&amp;D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo_oR7YO-Bw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introducing new players to TTRPGs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (specifically D&amp;D). I highly recommend you watch Matt’s videos, but I’m also going to offer my own perspective. Tabletop pen and paper games offer me a way to put myself into the role of someone completely different from myself, have adventures with friends, and use my imagination to create a world and story. It forces people to interact socially and work together. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I play tabletop games because it’s a hobby I can use in any town I may be in, and have an instant connection with other people that I can use to try and build a friendship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you want to get into tabletop RPGs, and don’t know how to start? Allow me to offer some simple steps to hop in:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41940" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dungeons__Dragons_Miniatures_2.jpg" alt="dungeons__dragons_miniatures_2" width="422" height="236" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dungeons__Dragons_Miniatures_2.jpg 422w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dungeons__Dragons_Miniatures_2-300x168.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dungeons__Dragons_Miniatures_2-298x167.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FIND A GROUP</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easiest way to find a group to play with is to ask your friends if they want to try out a game. Worst case scenario, they all say no, and you’re left in the same place you started. If you can’t find any of your friends to play with, find a group online through Roll20. This program boasts thousands on ongoing games at any point in time, and they have ways for players and game masters to find each other and play. You can also hit up </span><a href="http://geeklyinc.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the GeeklyInc forums</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has a number of active threads for different rule sets. Plus, you can get to know other Geeklies, and get involved in our community. It’s a win-win!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the first group you find turns out to not be a fit, don’t worry! Shopping around for the right group is not only perfectly acceptable, I would say it’s encouraged! These are the people you will be creating adventures and memories. So, you want to make sure you mesh well with the other players and the group as a whole. Be sure to talk to the game master of the group to find out what is expected, and what kind of game will be run. You’re the only one who knows what sounds fun to you, and what doesn’t.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41944" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dnd-book-collection.jpg" alt="dnd-book-collection" width="600" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dnd-book-collection.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dnd-book-collection-300x150.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dnd-book-collection-298x149.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FIND A RULESET</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the idea of playing in a futuristic world that combines magic and hacking? Check out <em>Shadowrun</em>. Do you yearn to live the life of a medieval hero, fighting dragons and slinging spells? <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> or <em>Pathfinder</em> may be the games for you. Maybe you want to fight along Harry Dresden in the mean streets of Chicago? Yes, there’s even an RPG ruleset for that. There are literally thousands of rulesets you can choose from for any kind of game. If you choose <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, Wizards of the Coast has a basic set of rules for </span><a href="http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/PlayerBasicRulesV03.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">players</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/DMBasicRulesV05.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the dungeon master</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available for free on their website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> or <em>Pathfinder</em> are both easy to learn as your first RPG experience. The rules are straightforward, and the decision making process is easy to adjust to. You roll a twenty-sided die (d20), and add or subtract any relevant modifiers. It doesn’t get much easier than that. Also in both cases, there is a vast amount of information on rules, character creation, and “world history” available online for free!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41939" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2307597701_f83aa41b6c_b.jpg" alt="2307597701_f83aa41b6c_b" width="490" height="368" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2307597701_f83aa41b6c_b.jpg 490w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2307597701_f83aa41b6c_b-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2307597701_f83aa41b6c_b-298x224.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CHOOSE A GAME MASTER</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the game master, this person’s role is to function as a storyteller, rule master, and antagonist to the player characters. The game master facilitates the plot, and describes everything that happens; it’s what Michael does in “Drunks and Dragons”. This can be a daunting position, but is very rewarding, and fun. To get some great tips from people I admire as GMs, check out Matt Colville’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-YZvLUXcR8&amp;list=PLlUk42GiU2guNzWBzxn7hs8MaV7ELLCP_" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running the Game series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or Matt Mercer and Geek and Sundry’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XikjjQok5Y&amp;list=PL7atuZxmT9570U87GhK_20NcbxM43vkom" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GM Tips series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They offer great advice, and good ideas for things to help build an adventure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In college, my friends and I had a rotating GM arrangement. Each person would create an adventure and build a small part of the overall world. Doing this allowed everyone to have a turn to play a character, and let each of us get experience running the game. Since most of us were new to the game, it helped all of us learn the rules and really get into the setting. It is also, partially, why I am now obsessed with TTRPGs.</span><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41942" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/D20_4510874033.jpg" alt="d20_4510874033" width="549" height="364" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/D20_4510874033.jpg 549w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/D20_4510874033-300x199.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/D20_4510874033-298x198.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CREATE CHARACTERS AND CHOOSE AN ADVENTURE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have an adventuring party, and a game master, all that’s left is to get your characters and choose an adventure. There are plenty of places to get pre generated characters, and Wizards of the Coast has full adventure books to run through. If your group is feeling truly adventurous (pun definitely intended), you can use the character generation process of whatever ruleset you decided to you. In <em>D&amp;D</em> this is done through either a point buy system where stat increases cost from a pool of “stat currency”, using a standard distribution of character stats (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8 assigned to the attributes), or roll four six-sided die and taking the sum of the highest three for each ability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite characters I’ve played are a Lionfolk Blackguard Paladin (a Thundercat with an attitude problem) who would loot any room or body he could find, and my current fast talking Wood Elf hunter/thief who talked a Dracolich into being the legal representative for the party’s shipping company for the low, low cost of smashing our semi-immortal paladin (it’s a long story involving a deck of many things, a Rakshasa, and a succubus lawyer).</span></p>

<p>In the last few years, with offerings like <em>Ex Machina</em>, <em>Gravity</em>, <em>Live Die Repeat</em>, <em>Interstellar</em> and, most recently, <em>The Martian</em>, sci-fi has slowly but surely broken away from its previous, mostly annual, role in cinema as one of the mindless and empty blockbuster movies you expect to see over summer. Granted, movies like that shitty Independence Day sequel are still around to fill that tired niche but sci-fi films that challenge you and make you think about your place in the world and the meaning of your life appear to be a growing and welcome trend; a new breed of sci-fi film, if you will. When I finally saw the trailer for <em>Arrival</em> I was eagerly anticipating this positive trend to continue.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41952" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Arrival-image-2-300x200.jpg" alt="arrival-image-2" width="744" height="496" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Arrival-image-2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Arrival-image-2-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Arrival-image-2-1200x800.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Arrival-image-2-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Arrival-image-2-620x413.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /></p>
<p>The movie centers around Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a linguist and college professor who is tasked with helping the military break the language barrier between them and the two alien hosts inhabiting one of twelve sleek, oblong river stone like spacecraft that touched down on earth a day or two before contacting her. Along with scientist Ian Donnelley (Jeremy Renner), Louise manages to successfully initiate the beginnings of a conversation but, with fear and panic setting in around the globe due to no one knowing what the aliens’ intentions are, they are pressed by the military to get answers. As a result, the question quickly becomes whether or not they can bridge the language gap in time, before the world falls apart.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41955" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hqdefault-300x225.jpg" alt="hqdefault" width="743" height="557" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hqdefault-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hqdefault-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hqdefault.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" /></p>
<p>Right off the bat, Amy Adams carries this film. From a series of quick opening scenes that I can only compare to Disney’s <em>UP</em>, she’s acting her ass off and from there, she’s in just about every scene in the movie. Ian and Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) are just two dimensional characters that are basically there to either emotionally support her (Ian) or put pressure on her (Weber) as she navigates her emotions while trying to determine what the aliens want. Mind you, they do a good job in their roles but make no mistake that even the alien hosts are thin and flimsy when contrasted to Adams and all the heavy lifting she is doing here. I can only guess why the aliens presented to us were so uninteresting but watching the process of them slowly (VERY slowly) but surely learning to communicate with her is pretty much the majority of this movie. There is a tie in to the events of the opening scene that weaves its way throughout and reveals itself at the very end and does, to its credit, add some emotional weight to the film, I still have to admit that the payoff was less than satisfying.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41954" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ARVL-04-1-1024x683-300x200.jpg" alt="arvl-04-1-1024x683" width="741" height="494" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ARVL-04-1-1024x683-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ARVL-04-1-1024x683-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ARVL-04-1-1024x683-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ARVL-04-1-1024x683-620x414.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ARVL-04-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /></p>
<p>On the plus side, one of the main reasons this movie managed to keep my attention was that the tone and mood of the film was done quite well. The movie maintains an underlying sense of dread throughout and does so without employing any of the hideous clichés we have come to know well in inferior offerings. Director Denis Villeneuve manages to get us, the viewers, to say “Oh dear God” under our breaths instead of one of its characters staring off into the sky and uttering it through a gaping maw after a melodramatic pause. The score is moody an ominous and watching it in 4k proved near over powering at times; it only relents in the end once the pseudo twist/reveal is made.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41951" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/amy-adams-in-human-tiff-55f67baa-4f7c-48a7-876e-e2e00cccf90a-300x169.jpg" alt="amy-adams-in-human-tiff-55f67baa-4f7c-48a7-876e-e2e00cccf90a" width="753" height="424" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/amy-adams-in-human-tiff-55f67baa-4f7c-48a7-876e-e2e00cccf90a-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/amy-adams-in-human-tiff-55f67baa-4f7c-48a7-876e-e2e00cccf90a-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/amy-adams-in-human-tiff-55f67baa-4f7c-48a7-876e-e2e00cccf90a-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/amy-adams-in-human-tiff-55f67baa-4f7c-48a7-876e-e2e00cccf90a.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></p>
<p>Overall I have to say that I left my noon showing feeling a little confused and empty. Was the entire reason the aliens were there what I thought I just saw in the ending?  If so, that’s kind of stupid. How did the rest of the world benefit from Louise’s revelation?  What happens to Ian when Louise tells him the truth?  These are just a couple of the questions I was left with when I exited the theater and frankly, I couldn’t care less if they ever get answered. I am pretty confident that if you saw this movie, you wouldn’t either. On a brighter note, it did momentarily take my mind off of being the thirteenth person in line at Gamestop this morning, only to have the store manager pass out twelve NES Classic Minis…</p>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION:</strong></p>
<p>While it’s well crafted and features a solid lead performance, the story is terribly slow and borderline boring. If you’re a sci-fi buff that has to watch em’ all or a part of an Amy Adams fan club, catch it on demand in a few months. Other than that, you can miss this one entirely.</p>
<p><strong>RATING: 2 STARS</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>WHAT YOU CAN WATCH INSTEAD OF (OR ALONG WITH) THIS:</strong></p>
<p>Charlie Sheens 1996 Sci-Fi offering called (interestingly enough) <em>The Arrival</em>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first began getting into board games, the social aspect was one of the biggest draws.  The whole idea of getting together with friends and family to share time around the table was a big part of why I loved the hobby. However, I would soon discover and learn to love what I feel is a somewhat misunderstood part of our community. When I played with my gaming group, my role fell into explaining the rules out to the rest of the players. I needed to learn all I could about the games to make it as easy as possible for the other players and setting up the entire game and playing for a few rounds by myself, gave me the best results.  When it came to fully cooperative games I found myself playing out the whole game on my own, and really loving the experience.  I started to seek out other games that would support this and to my surprise there was a slew of games to choose from. This started me on my path as a solo gamer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many people don’t get the draw of this niche and I completely understand. You are sitting alone doing something that is hailed as being a social activity, but I hope to give a few reasons why I personally am attracted to solo gaming. One of the biggest reasons I started solo gaming is the convenience.  If I decide that I feel like playing a game, I don’t need to get a group of people together and decide what to play; I just sit down and get started. Another reason is the fact that I don’t have to worry about teaching the game to anyone else.  I don’t know about you, but I often find teaching a game to be a stressful experience.  When I am on my own I am able to take my time going through the rules without anyone depending on me. Several games that I enjoy have a lot of things going on and can leave me with some tough decisions to make. If I’m playing on my own I am able to take as much time as I like on these choices without affecting anyone else. Even to the point of walking away from the game completely and coming back when I’m ready. My last point is speed. When playing a game solo the overall playtime compared to multiplayer can be shortened quite significantly. This makes is possible to get more gaming done and sometimes getting the same game played several times in a row.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41936" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MHPCR-Cover-3D_d92c-ya.png" alt="mhpcr-cover-3d_d92c-ya" width="506" height="380" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MHPCR-Cover-3D_d92c-ya.png 506w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MHPCR-Cover-3D_d92c-ya-300x225.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MHPCR-Cover-3D_d92c-ya-298x224.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One game that has filled this role for me as of late is a game published by Minion Games and designed by James Mathe called </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Manhattan Project: Chain Reaction</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In this card game you are trying to score as many points as possible by building bombs and sometimes loading those bombs onto planes. This is accomplished by supplying the labor and resources necessary to facilitate these projects. You will be playing out cards for either their personnel or building/ability. Every card has some value of general laborers, scientists or engineers on the left hand side that can be played sideways to activate the buildings on other cards. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41931" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-39-1.jpg" alt="picture-39" width="581" height="327" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-39-1.jpg 581w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-39-1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-39-1-298x168.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The buildings are mines that will allow you to generate yellowcake, enrichment plants where you’re able to refine yellowcake into uranium ingots, universities that can be used to gain a greater labor force, and factories increase your overall production potential by letting you add more card to your hand for that turn. As you gain more resources you will be able to spend them in order to build bombs from an array of face up cards worth different amounts of points depending on how expensive they are to build. As a solo player, you are trying to optimize every card to the best of your ability because the the game ends when the deck of cards runs out. In that time you are playing to try and score as many points as possible.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41932" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-38.jpg" alt="picture-38" width="581" height="327" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-38.jpg 581w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-38-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-38-298x168.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multiplayer game has a bit of a different feel as it has much more of a “race” feel because you are playing until a player reaches a certain number of points and finishing out the round. In the multiplayer game there is a “take that” element as there are a few cards that let you steal cards from other players hands or take some of their resources. Obviously this aspect of the game is lost in a solo game, but it plays such a small part of the multiplayer game that it isn&#8217;t missed.  Overall if you are looking for a filler solo game that you can get played in 10-15 minutes this is a good one. It’s not going to break your brain but it will give a few thing to think about as you puzzle out the best way to use the cards as you watch the deck set smaller and smaller.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">__________________________________________________________________  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are only a few bullet points and a small review but over the next few months I hope to go further in depth as I talk about other games from the perspective of me as a solo gamer. Both games that are intended to be played exclusively as solo games and ones that come with rules for solo variants. What do you think about solo gaming in general? Have you ever tried it? I would love to hear input from people!        </span></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been out of the comic book game for a long time. Let&#8217;s just say the last time I was really serious about comics, Superman was coming back from the dead. So, when I decided I wanted to get back into the game, I didn&#8217;t know where to start.<br />
Thinking I&#8217;d want to read in bulk my first time out, I decided to pick up a volume collection. At the bookstore I faced a sea of masks and muscles I didn&#8217;t know how to cope with. Knowing I&#8217;ve always been drawn more to Marvel, that&#8217;s how I began to narrow down my choice. Then Ms. Marvel herself grabbed my attention. I picked up Ms. Marvel volume #1 “No Normal,” which covers issues 1-5 of Ms. Marvel 2014.</p>
<p>A great deal of debate surrounds the issue of diversity in media. In comics this sometimes revolves around how best to introduce minority characters into the mythos; whether to make totally new characters who represent minority groups, or to change the race, ethnicity, gender, or sexuality of an existing character. Ms. Marvel takes a third option. Here we find a new face taking on the mantel of a familiar hero, then carving out a niche for herself.<br />
I&#8217;ve often heard it said that Superman is essentially an immigrant story. Superman is the outsider who makes good, given that he&#8217;s an alien. But, Superman is ultimately a story about a white guy. Ms. Marvel lends some authenticity to the discussion, being an emblem of otherness on several levels.</p>
<p>I would gladly read about Kamala Khan even if she weren&#8217;t a superhero. Kamala is a complex girl from an immigrant family. Enough said. The forces that pull on her in her normal life are enough to make a compelling story. From her visits to the mosque where she chats with her friend during the youth lecture, to the &#8220;Fantabulous Hakka&#8221; takeout food she eats as a midnight snack, G. Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona expertly weave little moments and details into the story that speak volumes about how Kamala lived her life before getting her powers. I would have liked to see more of that.<br />
On the subject of powers, I&#8217;d have to say that&#8217;s where the book falls a little short. One thing I appreciate about Marvel is that there are no monolithic powerhouses. No one is O.P. That&#8217;s why there are so many great teams in Marvel comics. There&#8217;s always a great &#8220;you complete me&#8221; vibe.</p>
<p>Ms. Marvel&#8217;s vulnerabilities are obvious, and that&#8217;s fine. I just don&#8217;t see anything fresh about her powers. She is a little Ant Man, a little Mr. Fantastic, with some shape-shifting and accelerated healing thrown in. In a way, the hum-drum nature of her powers fits the book. I wasn&#8217;t caught up in wondering how her powers work, rather I thought more about how and why she would use her powers. I thought more about her choices. However, it left me wishing they did something new and exciting with them.</p>
<p>Ms. Marvel is a good read. The tension between normal life and Kamala&#8217;s burgeoning crime-fighting career plays out in a novel and fun way. While her powers are a little tired it&#8217;s still satisfying to see her scrap with the robots and punks of Jersey City. The series brings with it questions about identity and belonging I don&#8217;t remember the comics of my youth exploring quite so well. I look forward to further forays into the world of Kamala Khan. She&#8217;s definitely not your dad&#8217;s superhero.</p>

<p>One of the things I have been getting a bit nerdy about lately is smartwatches. Despite not using my current watch very much beyond sitting on my wrist slowly ticking time away, I like having the option to use it during a workout.</p>
<p>During my training in Tae Kwon Do, our instructor highly recommended that we remove all jewelry since it can very easily get snagged on clothing or be broken if hit too hard. So as such, I removed my wedding ring, necklace and watch if I wore one.</p>
<p>However, there is no doubt that a smartwatch is an incredibly helpful aid in getting fit. They count your steps, track your heart rate, /evil <em><strong>watch you while you sleep</strong></em> and can help you track how much water your drink during the day. During your workout, you can set timers if you’re working on some interval training, set a target heart rate, track your speed, listen to music, etc. There are a myriad of apps for both Apple and Android (not sure about compatibility with Windows, however) that can help you to either lose weight or get buff.</p>
<p>If a watch isn’t what you’re looking at for a workout your phone may work better for you. From apps like Couch to 5k or PokemonGo, if you just look under health and fitness you’ll find something that will work for you. I’ve gone through many apps myself and while some work better than others, there are two that I keep going back to. Namely MyFitnessPal and Bodyweight Fitness. One to track my food and the other for my workouts. If you enjoy music, you probably already have an app of choice. Amazon Music has been pretty stellar for me lately, while Pandora and Spotify are excellent as well.</p>
<p>For home use, there are three types of cardio machines that, depending upon your needs of cardio, work rather well: treadmills, rowing machines, or stationary bikes. On these, I don’t have too much experience other than using the bikes or rowing machines at the gym. I have a rowing machine at home that I like and a recumbent stationary bike I like to use as well. The calorie tracking on both tend to be sub par but that’s not my needs. Do your research and take a couple for a spin at a local equipment store if you can. If you’re looking for a gym at home, consider asking what your local gym uses and get a home model version.</p>
<p>I am currently into a bodyweight fitness routine I found on <em>Reddit</em> that I can’t stop recommending. In the beginning, it&#8217;s low impact on the joints and you progress in difficulty as you become more proficient at the exercises and techniques. Consider it a fitness RPG if you will. I bought myself a set of olympic rings and am currently doing rows, pull ups and push ups on them. I bought some padded mats for my garage and, for maybe less than $200, I have a home gym that will progress with me as I get better.</p>
<p>So if you are looking to get some tech for your workout:</p>
<p>Smartwatches &#8211; yes (do not get a dedicated workout watch)</p>
<p>Phone &#8211; yes</p>
<p>Apps &#8211; yes (test before you buy)</p>
<p>Exercise equipment &#8211; maybe</p>

This isn’t our usual round of Geekly Grooves but, as an avid concert goer and lover of music, I felt the need to share my most recent concert experience with you all. This may also happen from time to time since I try to go to at least one concert every month. Expect a peppering of these concert experiences paired with an album review! Let’s get into it! First, the album…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="wp-image-41871 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/divine-300x300.jpg" alt="divine" width="596" height="596" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/divine-300x300.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/divine-150x150.jpg 150w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/divine-180x180.jpg 180w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/divine-600x600.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/divine-75x75.jpg 75w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/divine-298x298.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/divine-620x620.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/divine.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /><br />
Mac Miller<br />
<em>The Divine Feminine</em><br />
2016<br />
Genre: Hip-Hop</p>
<p>The fourth studio album by the 24 year old Pittsburgh native, <em>The Divine Feminine</em> is a soulful and funky trip from start to finish. The album features many high profile guests including Bilal, Anderson Paak, Ariana Grande, CeeLo Green, Kendrick Lamar, and more. The concept behind <em>The Divine Feminine</em>, in Mac Miller’s own words is, “It’s love, which is the simplest answer, but the most complex of topics. It’s the religious experience of going into that emotion.”</p>
<p>The album starts with “Congratulations”, after a short female sung intro, we are greeted by some very smooth and romantic sounding piano that actually made the hair on my arms stand up the first time I heard it. Mac Miller makes himself known by muttering “Love, love love love love love,” only to be interrupted by a much deeper, distorted voice proclaiming, “SEX”. This can be construed as what could have been the original outline for the album. Instead, a more appropriate opening line would have been, “Sex, sex sex sex sex sex LOVE.” While the album is extremely well crafted and produced, Mac’s lyrics tend to lean from quirky and clever to vulgar and cringey. Despite the slight awkward moment or two (especially the couple times on the album that features a woman just moaning in pleasure), <em>The Divine Feminine</em> really sets itself apart from Mac’s other albums. Songs like “Dang!” and “My Favorite Part” make you want to get up and dance. On the latter, Mac Miller is joined by newly confirmed girlfriend Ariana Grande and their chemistry shines through even though Mac is singing instead of rapping. While he doesn&#8217;t sport the best singing voice, it is a welcome change up and perfectly suits the vibe of the album as a whole.</p>
<p>Personal Thoughts:</p>
<p>I really enjoy this album. While some parts are a tad awkward, <em>The Divine Feminine</em> is different from anything that’s coming out right now. It’s funky, fresh, and fun. Stand out songs include “Congratulations”, <a href="https://youtu.be/LR3GQfryp9M">“Dang!”</a>, “Planet God Damn”, and “My Favorite Part”.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-41872 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image1.jpg" alt="image1" width="2208" height="1242" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image1.jpg 2208w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image1-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image1-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image1-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image1-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 2208px) 100vw, 2208px" /></p>
<p>On to the show! Mac Miller, even though this album is a more mature and softer effort, is known for big party songs and energetic shows. His music is more suited to house parties than intimate jams so it’s understandable that his first outing in such an area would be imperfect. The concert took place in my favorite local venue, <em>The Observatory</em> in Orange County, which is small, general admission, and perfect for this kind of show.</p>
<p>The lights went out after the opening DJ finished his set and the crowd went crazy. Two strobe lights flashed on on either side of the stage and the voice of Ty Dolla $ign came blaring out of the speakers as he sang the opening lines of “Cinderella” off of <em>The Divine Feminine</em>. Mac came running out from behind the stage and immediately jumped into the first verse, the crowd miming his every word. He then launched into a small medley of songs from his last two albums, <em>Watching Movies With The Sound Off</em> and <em>GO:OD AM</em>. The crowd danced, jumped, screamed, and rapped along with him as they pushed me from the back of the pit all the way to the front with every song. By the end of the hour and a half long set, I was battered, bruised, and covered in sweat, most of it not my own. He thanked the crowd for our energy especially in this stressful time and took his leave after performing two final songs, “Nikes On My Feet” from the 2010 mixtape <em>K.I.D.S.</em> and “When In Rome” from <em>GO:OD AM</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s November again and that means it&#8217;s National Novel Writing Month, where writers attempt to write a 50,000-word novel from November 1st until November 30th. It is safe to say that there is an intersection of storytellers who want to write a novel and those who run games of <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, <em>Pathfinder</em>, and other tabletop games. How then can a Dungeon Master apply what he&#8217;s learned running a game to writing a novel in one month?</p>
<div id="attachment_41854" style="width: 723px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-41854" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2015-04-14-05.56.38-300x190.jpg" alt="Comic by Tom Gauld" width="713" height="451" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2015-04-14-05.56.38-300x190.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2015-04-14-05.56.38-298x189.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2015-04-14-05.56.38-620x393.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2015-04-14-05.56.38.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Comic by Tom Gauld</p></div>
<p>For starters, you can do all the preparation you want when running a D&amp;D game but your players may not make the decisions you&#8217;ve prepared for. Your big bad is at the top of the tower full of orcs? Well, the wizard threw a fireball into a barrack full of orcs and now your precious tower is burning down. Throw the big bad&#8217;s monologue right out the window. That&#8217;ll teach you to make a tower made of wood. The same goes for making preparations for your NaNoWriMo novel. Outlining, world-building, and examining your characters helps but when you&#8217;ve hit the roadblock, it&#8217;ll throw your preparation out the window.</p>
<div id="attachment_41850" style="width: 744px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-41850 " src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/tumblr_n2n4om4ORm1rwkrdbo1_1280-300x191.jpg" alt="Comic by Tom Gauld" width="734" height="468" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/tumblr_n2n4om4ORm1rwkrdbo1_1280-300x191.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/tumblr_n2n4om4ORm1rwkrdbo1_1280-298x189.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/tumblr_n2n4om4ORm1rwkrdbo1_1280-620x394.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Comic by Tom Gauld</p></div>
<p>So what do you do? Your players are waiting and the game must go on. So does your word count. You&#8217;ll groan, press your fingers to your sinuses, and keep going despite the burning tower your players have left in their wake. The same goes for that burning tower of a sentence you left behind you in order to reach your goal for the day. In a D&amp;D session, you can&#8217;t overthink it because your players are waiting for the story to continue. You have to apply that same logic to your novel because the goal isn&#8217;t to have the best novel in a month. A novel for publishing takes time. You write your first draft, then your second, then more after that. You proofread it, edit it, and send it to beta readers before you might ever send it to a publisher or literary agent.</p>
<div id="attachment_41846" style="width: 732px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-41846 " src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hero_dmgscreen_0-1200x375.jpg" alt="Roll for initiative." width="722" height="226" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hero_dmgscreen_0-1200x375.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hero_dmgscreen_0-300x94.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hero_dmgscreen_0-768x240.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hero_dmgscreen_0-298x93.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hero_dmgscreen_0-620x194.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Get out from behind your DM screen and write.</p></div>
<p>No, NaNoWriMo is a way to teach yourself how to form good writing habits by not overthinking and just writing. Let&#8217;s say your novel is your D&amp;D campaign. Your protagonist, a.k.a. one of your players comes up to an NPC you don&#8217;t have a name for. Are you going to sit there and worry about his or her name or are you going to name him Gary the dwarf and move on? When you have to write 50,000 words in a month there&#8217;s going to be a lot of Garys running around, some of them may or may not be dwarves. The same goes for the plot, the setting, and the dialogue.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41853" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-05-09-08.01.08-300x197.jpg" alt="2016-05-09-08-01-08" width="766" height="503" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-05-09-08.01.08.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-05-09-08.01.08-298x196.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using NaNoWriMo to write a fantasy novel, use that to your advantage. All the information you&#8217;ve learned about weapons, spells, armor, and monsters can all be tweaked for your novel. The story hooks you&#8217;ve used to get the ball rolling? That could be the plot or sub-plot of your novel. Use your dice if you have to. All the random tables you&#8217;ve gathered from your Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide and online can help you push through that block your mind won&#8217;t. Also, if you&#8217;ve been running a homebrewed campaigned, don&#8217;t be afraid to use that for the story. You took the time to develop that world and those characters for your game, why not your novel?</p>
<div id="attachment_41851" style="width: 912px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-41851" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14937322_1022314464545421_3509226442224065266_n-300x191.jpg" alt="Comic by Tom Gauld" width="902" height="573" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14937322_1022314464545421_3509226442224065266_n-300x191.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14937322_1022314464545421_3509226442224065266_n-298x190.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14937322_1022314464545421_3509226442224065266_n.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Comic by Tom Gauld</p></div>
<p>When you sit down with your friends behind your DM screen or your computer to run your game, you&#8217;ll have to make decisions then and there based on your player&#8217;s decisions. Writing your novel for National Novel Writing Month gives you more control and you&#8217;ll have to get in the mindset of making the same kind of decisions to reach your goal. Your D&amp;D session may not go the way you imagined it but you got together with your friends and had fun telling a story together, right? Your novel may not be the New York Times Bestseller you hoped it would be but on December 1st, you can look at what you&#8217;ve achieved and know you sat down and did the work. Congratulations, you wrote a novel, dungeon master!</p>

<p>Now that Askur is out of the way no one stands before us and our goal of eliminating Longcryer. So much of what we have done has lead us to this moment, even if it was just a side quest. While it is possible that Longcryer has some sort of information about who is trying to destabilize the major cities of the land we are simply here to put a mad beast down. Perhaps correcting the mistakes that still linger from your past somewhat lessens your sins? Doubtful, but revenge ought to feel pretty great.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a child, I remember the days of creating heroic encounters using my favorite action figures. I would pit my favorite figure, “Heavy Metal Rock Star Raphael”, against a slew of other figures ranging from </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batman</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power Rangers</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>,</em> and even </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Max </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">characters. These “fierce battles” encompassed a majority of my time as a child and even as an adult I would find myself imagining these “what if” scenarios in my head. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wizkids</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a New Jersey based game publisher, has a solution for anyone wanting to revisit those nostalgic childhood adventures. Enter </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroclix</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the collectible miniature tabletop game that gives you the opportunity to make your &#8220;what if?&#8221; Scenarios into a reality. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I happened upon </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroclix</span> </em><span style="font-weight: 400;">while visiting my local comic store back in July of 2015. The store was running a special in store event based on Marvel’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Age of Ultron</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Being primarily a Marvel fan, and always wanting to try new things, I attempted to join the event. The event itself was a “sealed” event which holds the same meaning for those </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pokémon</span> </em><span style="font-weight: 400;">players. I was to buy two boosters and make a team from what I pulled from the boosters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figures in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroclix</span> </em><span style="font-weight: 400;">are marked with a point cost on their dial. Using these point costs, I was to make a team whose total point cost didn&#8217;t go over 300 points. The average point cost per figure is between 90-110 points with figures as high as 1000 and as low as 10. Being new to the game, I was very unfamiliar with any sort of strategy, and luckily the other players at the event were helpful in making sure I started with something decent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My first <em>Heroclix</em> team consisted of two figures:  Hercules at 220 points and Wasp at 70 which put me at 290 points. I had no clue at the time if my team was any good, but I was a fan of Hercules. Wasp got me closest to the 300 point maximum. The event began and was played in the traditional 1 vs 1 Swiss format tournament. I was seated with my first opponent and that’s where my </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroclix</span> </em><span style="font-weight: 400;">journey began&#8230;</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41830" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image4.jpg" alt="image4" width="504" height="378" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image4.jpg 504w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image4-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image4-298x224.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Basics of <em>Heroclix </em>Combat:</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroclix</span> </em><span style="font-weight: 400;">is typically played on a 36” by 24” grid map that contains two starting zones for players. Each player begins the match rolling two six sided dice to determine who is the first player.  First player gets to choose what map to play on and the second player chooses which of the two starting zones they want to start in. Players then place their figures on the map in their respective starting zones and the first player begins their turn. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroclix</span> </em><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a game of actions similar to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dungeons and Dragons</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Each team gets a set amount of actions per turn depending on the point limit of the event. For every 100 points of a team build, you get one action. For my 300 point</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Age of Ultron</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> event, each turn I was able to do 3 actions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figures are also limited in actions. After doing a non-free action, an action token is given to the figure. Figures can have up to two action tokens at a time. When they reach two action tokens, the figure can not take any non-free actions until they clear away the action tokens. Action tokens are cleared at the end of a turn that the figure took no non-free actions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are five types of actions in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroclix</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><strong>Move Actions:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the title implies, move actions are actions you take to move your figure around the field. When figures are given a move action, they may move up to their speed value (although there are power, abilities, and map terrain that may alter how far they can move). One piece of information to keep in mind is that not all moves are move actions. Certain powers and abilities allow you move and attack by using a &#8220;power action&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><strong>Power Actions:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power actions are unusual in that they are completely reliant on your figure having certain powers. To put it simply, power actions are actions that activate a power or ability the figure possesses. We will touch powers and abilities in a later article. </span></p>
<p><strong>Close And Ranged Combat Actions: </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Close and ranged combat actions are taken to attack another figure. Close combat actions always lead to a close combat attack and ranged combat actions always lead to a ranged combat attack. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroclix</span> </em><span style="font-weight: 400;">differentiates between combat/ranged </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attacks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and combat/ranged </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This difference will be explained more with powers and abilities. </span></p>
<p><strong>Free Actions:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free actions are actions that don&#8217;t place an action token on the figure. You are not limited in the number of free actions you do a turn but figures may only perform the same free action once a turn. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41828" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image3-1.jpg" alt="image3" width="504" height="378" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image3-1.jpg 504w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image3-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image3-1-298x224.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Having the Figures Duke It Out:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once I had learned how to give my figures actions to actually do something, I was ready for Hercules to smash some heads together. Before I could really get going I needed to understand what values Hercules had. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each figure has a dial that displayed their current values. The dial as seen above gives multiple values with four distinct values that can change when a figure takes damage. Whenever a figure takes damage, you turn the dial clockwise. One point of damage taken equals one click clockwise. As you can see below, Hercules’ dial looks different once he has taken two damage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are four values that can change on a dial when it is clicked:</span></p>
<p><strong>Speed Value (Boot Symbol)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; How many squares your figure can move. </span></p>
<p><strong>Attack Value (Fist Symbol)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Starting attack value when making an attack. </span></p>
<p><strong>Defense Value (Shield Symbol)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Starting defense value that opponents have to meet or exceed to deal damage</span></p>
<p><strong>Damage Value (Starburst Symbol)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; How much damage the figure does when you succeed in hitting with an attack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a couple static values that don’t change when the dial is clicked: </span></p>
<p><strong>Range Value (Found above the Starburst Symbol)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; How many squares away you can make a ranged attack on an enemy figure. If the range is 0, then the figure can only make close attacks if they have no special abilities or powers that give them range. </span></p>
<p><strong>Number of Targets (Lightning Bolt Symbol next to Range)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; How many enemy figures you can target with a ranged attack. Each lightning bolt equals one target.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41829" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BebopClix-1.jpg" alt="bebopclix-1" width="504" height="378" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BebopClix-1.jpg 504w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BebopClix-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BebopClix-1-298x224.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>How attacks work in <i>Heroclix:</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attacking in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroclix</span> </em><span style="font-weight: 400;">is fairly simple. If I&#8217;m in range and in a position to attack another figure, I take an action to make an attack.  When attacking, you roll two six sided dice and add those to your attack value.  If the sum is equal or greater than the opponent&#8217;s defense value, then you hit. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroclix</span> </em><span style="font-weight: 400;">does utilize critical hits and misses. If you roll two sixes, you deal an additional point of damage. If you roll two ones, then you automatically miss your attack and your figure takes one unavoidable damage. My Hercules starts out with a 9 movement, 11 attack and a 17 defense. If I wanted to attack with Hercules, it would have to be close range since his range is 0. His 11 attack is very good as defense values range between 15-19 on average. I knew that Hercules was more than capable of leading my team to victory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next time, we will take a look into the different powers and abilities figures in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroclix</span> </em><span style="font-weight: 400;">have to offer and how they influence the battle. </span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Mysterium</em>, the hit murder mystery board game by Libellud, will be getting a digital makeover as it hits iOS, Android and Steam this coming December. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winner of the Golden Geek and As d’Or 2016 Game of the Year awards, <em>Mysterium </em>has enchanted and mystified thousands of players worldwide. Aiming to stay faithful to the original game, Asmodee Digital is hoping to translate the unique play style of <em>Mysterium</em> while providing unique features to the digital version.</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-41803 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ghost-checks-all-enigmas.jpg" alt="ghost-checks-all-enigmas" width="890" height="501" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ghost-checks-all-enigmas.jpg 2560w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ghost-checks-all-enigmas-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ghost-checks-all-enigmas-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ghost-checks-all-enigmas-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ghost-checks-all-enigmas-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ghost-checks-all-enigmas-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px" /></p>
<p>When the game first launches, players will have the ability to play through the story of the first original psychic. It has been released that the other five psychics will be available for play through later free updates. If you are still wanting more than traditional game play, players will be able to interact with &#8220;Hidden Signs&#8221;; which will work to enhance the game with new mysteries and new elements to discover. This update is slated to be available with the release of the main game, but as an in app purchase. The best part of this update is that it will allow for more play with just one player or with friends!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit of having a digital version is the flexibility and convenience of finding players online to help solve the mystery. </span></p>
<p>For multiplayer options, <em>Mysterium</em> will allow players to join together from all over where an in-game chat system is in place to give players the chance to help each other out. One way is through being able to point out the visual clues on a card. Using &#8220;Clairvoyance Tokens&#8221;, psychics will be able to share visions and approve or deny the choices with the rest of the players. In multiplayer, <em>Mysterium</em> will be able to host up to seven players, who can work to discover the manor&#8217;s mysteries. For those wanting a single player option though; that will be available as well through &#8220;Story Mode&#8221;. In single player, the game will provide hours of fun in allowing players to investigate and discover who was murdered, where, and with what weapon.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-41802 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mediums-progress-in-their-investigation.jpg" alt="mediums-progress-in-their-investigation" width="889" height="500" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mediums-progress-in-their-investigation.jpg 2560w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mediums-progress-in-their-investigation-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mediums-progress-in-their-investigation-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mediums-progress-in-their-investigation-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mediums-progress-in-their-investigation-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mediums-progress-in-their-investigation-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Mysterium</em> will be available in early December on iOS and Android for $6.99 and on Steam for $9.99.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay tuned in December for an in depth review of the <em>Mysterium</em> digital game and its comparison to its tabletop brother.  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-41779 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lev-wakes-300x169.jpg" alt="lev-wakes" width="742" height="418" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lev-wakes-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lev-wakes-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lev-wakes-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lev-wakes-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lev-wakes.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /></p>
<p>Imagine you’re stuck on a space station. Hundreds are dead all around you, while thousands more have been rounded up and shoved into rooms by heavily armed men. Your only friend is an old, wore out detective who has seen too much and doesn’t seem to care if he lives or dies. You have been working with him for a week. He drinks too much and his pale, grey skin looks sickly. The bread crumb trail of the missing girl you’re looking for has led you here, and now you are really beginning to regret ever offering to help the detective out. You have no weapons and your only means of escape is parked on the other side of this massive space station. Oh and by the way, there also appears to be some sort of biological weapon being released, turning the living and the dead into…something else.</p>
<p><em>The Expanse</em> series by James S. A. Corey is quickly becoming a large and defining series in the space opera genre. Not only are there more novels planned for the main storyline, but there is also a collection of short stories and novellas currently written. If you are looking for a series to fall into, and you want something that is more than space ships in space, then you should read this. If books aren’t your thing, then take a look at the TV series, <em>The Expanse</em>, which was made by Syfy. Even though Syfy’s history with different TV series has been fairly hit or miss, this one is definitely a hit  It captures the mood and feel of the series and the writing and casting is mostly on point.</p>
<p>Set in the not too distant future <em>Leviathan Wakes</em>, the first book in the series, follows the crew of an ice hauler and a detective on the dwarf plant Ceres. James Holden, executive office of the ice hauler, has chosen his life running ice. Once a member of the Mars Navy, now Holden is just looking for a pay check. On this run he gets a lot more than he bargained for. While searching a derelict ship with a small detachment of its crew, they witness their ship being blown up by a mysterious organization. Meanwhile Josephus Miller, a rung out police officer and detective, is investigating the disappearance of a missing girl which he soon finds to be much more than a simple missing person case. After both Miller’s and Holden’s stories interweave, what was a detective story becomes one about saving humanity. Holden and Miller must risk everything in order to save anything.</p>
<p>If you are looking for just another space opera, then this will satisfy your needs, but it will also deliver so much more. This is a character driven story, involving locations all over the solar system, with a plot that puts almost everything else in this genre to shame. <em>The Expanse</em> series is available for purchase on Amazon, or if you’d rather listen to your books, then try Audible. The next book, <em>Babylon&#8217;s Ashes, is</em> due out this December so it’s a great time to jump in on this awesome series.</p>

Geekly Grooves is a way for the community to share their favorite artists and albums with each other. Every couple weeks we will be pulling album recommendations from you via Twitter or the Forums. A few of us will dedicate some time to listen to an album and we will report back here to you with a short overview and our personal thoughts on it! It’s just another nifty way to connect with your fellow Geeklies over a mutual love of music!<br />
The following is just a small taste of what you guys can expect to find here. If you enjoy the article then please feel free to send us your album recommendations and of course some feedback in the comments or Forums! Thank you!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Dance Gavin Dance<br />
Tree City Sessions<br />
2016<br />
Genre: Rock</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This week we have the album Tree City Sessions from Sacramento based band, Dance Gavin Dance. Recommend to us by fellow Geekly @ryanSCBsantos on Twitter, this album is a sonic force to be reckoned with! The album is a live compilation album including songs from each of the band&#8217;s earlier works sung by current vocalists Tilian Pearson and Jon Mess.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The album kicks off with “Alex English”, a song off the band&#8217;s original self titled album. Pearson manages to make this and other earlier songs his own with his high pitched falsettos mixing very cleanly with Mess&#8217; screamed vocals. Guitarist, Will Swan, shines throughout the album with his furious fretwork and still manages to fit some of his own vocals on a rap sung verse on the song “Spooks”. This album and more by Dance Gavin Dance can be found on Spotify and iTunes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Personal Thoughts: Buckle in for this one Geeklies! You&#8217;re in for quite a ride! Stand out songs include Lemon Meringue Tie,<a href="https://youtu.be/IiX8GCwDupw"> We Own The Night, and Carl Barker.</a></p>

<p>My name is John and I’ve been a fan of GeeklyInc for a very long time. I’d like to share my experience with you all of taking the next step in running games. My first real convention game that I ran was a <em>Numenera</em> game at Acadecon 2015. After picking up the pace in my home games, I then branched out to run an official Monte Cook Games session during GenCon 2016. Something clicked after that GenCon game that changed me. I was gathering up my materials and tucking the chairs back in when I noticed just how happy I was with myself that I did it. I knew right then that I wanted to do this more&#8230;a lot more, in fact. The next week upon returning home I started cracking open RPG books, trying to absorb as many systems as I could. I even signed up to join the Asset Team for Monte Cook Games so I could start running supported demos around where I live. The other crazy thing I did? I submitted to run <strong>THREE</strong> games at AcadeCon 2016 this year. Three games of three separate systems including: <em>Numenera, Shadow of the Demon Lord</em>, and <em>7th Sea Second Edition</em>. I want to talk specifically about <em>7th Sea</em>, though, because the process of learning this system challenged my understanding of how an RPG should be run and how it should be played.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41718" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sorte.jpg" alt="sorte" width="600" height="388" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sorte.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sorte-300x194.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sorte-298x193.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>When I received my copy of <em>7th Sea Second Edition</em> and started reading it, I was a little overwhelmed with what the system was asking. I was trying to fit it into the box of the d20 success or failure resolution mechanic that I was used to. When your character attempts something that the GM determines requires a roll (referred to in game as a “risk”), you roll a number of d10’s equal to your points in a given trait plus ranks in a given skill. You put together sets of 10 and those sets are counted and referred to as “raises”. These raises are then spent within a given “scene” to fuel the actions taken in an action or dramatic sequence, depending on what is going on in the story. Where my understanding broke down was where the success versus failure came into play. The game appears to assume that unless you CHOOSE to fail (which actually rewards you in a way); you succeed at what you want to do. The raises you generate can be spent to change the scene in different ways depending on what is presented by the GM, in the form of “consequences” and “opportunities”. Where the decision lies is in what to spend your raises on. Do I want to spend my raises to escape the bad guys, or do I want to avoid a few of them, grab the sacred statue and take some wounds in the process? Either way I’m advancing forward in an interesting and exciting way. It’s up the player to determine in what way that happens.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41713" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7thsea2e_classical_map_of_theah.jpg" alt="7thsea2e_classical_map_of_theah" width="1200" height="927" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7thsea2e_classical_map_of_theah.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7thsea2e_classical_map_of_theah-300x232.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7thsea2e_classical_map_of_theah-768x593.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7thsea2e_classical_map_of_theah-298x230.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7thsea2e_classical_map_of_theah-620x479.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Not only do the rules lend themselves to an exciting adventure for players, the setting of <em>7th Sea Second Edition</em> has its own wonderful place in the game. <em>7th Sea</em> is set in a fictional analog of 17th Century Europe called Théah. There are certain historical similarities with the nation states and certain political and cultural story beats, but it’s described in the book as being a “distant cousin” of Europe….but with SORCERY!! That really helped make learning about the setting easier and familiar; especially with a third of the 300 pages being dedicated to the setting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41716" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/video-634778-h264_high2.jpg" alt="video-634778-h264_high2" width="640" height="360" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/video-634778-h264_high2.jpg 640w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/video-634778-h264_high2-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/video-634778-h264_high2-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/video-634778-h264_high2-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>So I stare at these words that appear to be saying to me… “Hey, John. You know how you’ve always seen RPGs as sort of a GM versus players to the death type situation? Yeah forget that, brah. From now on, when you run games, you and the players will be telling an awesome story together because that’s fun as hell and super easy with these rules! Oh, and character death should be epic and meaningful and part of the player&#8217;s story, not a by-product of luck”. When I’m preparing to run all these games for Acadecon, I’m no longer looking at these rulebooks in terms of technicalities and mechanics, such as how to structure encounters or making sure the players are using the rules correctly. While that is important, I’m preparing for these games by coming up with interesting situations to put the players in that are exciting, and perhaps a little stressful. I’ve decided to take what I love about role playing and try to bring that out in the players at the table. The gut wrenching decision-making that has in game consequences; where neither option seems best, yet a course must be chosen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41717" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/8627b5623cd9898d15c58f2ebd680f05_original.jpg" alt="8627b5623cd9898d15c58f2ebd680f05_original" width="460" height="298" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/8627b5623cd9898d15c58f2ebd680f05_original.jpg 460w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/8627b5623cd9898d15c58f2ebd680f05_original-300x194.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/8627b5623cd9898d15c58f2ebd680f05_original-298x193.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p>A con game should be exciting and surprising, providing an environment for a player to take the reigns a little bit and drive the story their own way that makes them excited to play. Getting to react as the GM to this new information and craft an interesting adventure from that, is really what I’m taking away from <em>7th Sea Second Edition</em>. It’s made me realize what I want out of a gaming experience, both as a player and most importantly to me personally, as a GM. I’ve also realized that I might have some things to say and hopefully discuss about playing and running games in this way. The message of my article series on being a new GM, at least initially here, is that I was someone who believed I couldn’t, or shouldn’t be trying to pursue a more active role in the RPG community as a whole for whatever reasons I was force feeding myself. If any of my experiences can help more of us come into the hobby then I’m all in and on board to help! Now, GO PLAY GAMES!!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again. This episode was fantastic. I think we are nearing the robot uprising the show has been promising from the beginning. Maeve is getting a serious upgrade that could spell doom for the humans. That whiny story man is pissing away his career. Ford is probably a robot, come on sheeple. And the MIB meets the real teddy.</p>
<p>The final four episodes are looking to be fantastic.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-41746 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-2-300x125.jpg" alt="unnamed-2" width="823" height="343" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-2-300x125.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-2-298x124.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-2-620x258.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-2.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /></p>
<p>The theater was filled with sweatshirts and ball caps labelled Marvel. Avid talks of comics, Steve Ditko, and psychedelics snuck through the aisles like whispers of dark and ancient secrets. “Have you read <em>The Omen</em>? They call Doctor Strange Sherlock in that one. Probably why they cast Benedict Cumberbatch.” “Why is Tilda Swinton the Ancient One? She’s not Tibetan!” These were my kind of people.</p>
<p>The IMAX theater opened with rising excitement for new movies and trailers. Transitions between them to the movie, as well as the kind notes telling us to “Turn off your phone” and “Don’t bring your own commentary” were illustrated in blasting sound waves and puffs of galaxies. A silent wind of watoomb swept our seats.</p>
<p><em>Doctor Strang</em> is not a good Marvel movie. It’s an amazing movie all on its own. Being a part of the Marvel Movie Universe only enhances it. The pacing was something I’ve always wanted in recent films, plenty of fast paced action with time to breath in-between. Moments where you can let what’s happening settle in. The montages &#8211; it’s an origin movie, there’s going to be montages &#8211; were smooth and effortless. Tilda Swinton, who plays the Ancient One, and director Scott Derrickson say they were inspired by <em>The Guardians of the Galaxy</em> film and how it could stand alone and reveal a new world different from what we had been shown in the other Marvel movies.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41748 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-300x169.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="726" height="409" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-620x350.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></p>
<p>The pacing was astounding on this magic carpet ride. Derrickson clearly laid out a three act story that has you feeling as desperate for more. The artwork was heavily relied on and inspired by Steve Ditko’s original artwork. The trippy comics first appeared in the early sixties personifying the import of mysticism and acid. The film, however, doesn’t retain that hippy vibe. Derrickson has said that the technology used to make this film didn’t exist two years ago, let alone 20. I personally haven’t seen a film with such crystal clarity and meant that in its fullest intent.</p>
<p>The film is absurdly relevant to today in such simple ways. I won’t spoil it for you, but I’ll tell you that Doctor Strange begins his journey hitting close to home for everyone. His medical practices, attempts at finding a cure and WiFi, were familiar and refreshingly simple. There was no nudge from the comedy. No hesitant moment to say, “Eh? Ya get it?” Each modern reference or slapstick piece of humor was deftly handled, as has become the mantra of Marvel films. There are hints of <em>The Three Stooges</em> and <em>Abbott &amp; Costello</em> that toss the humor quick as a firecracker and it’s gone, letting the story move on quickly.</p>
<p>Benedict Cumberbatch did a fantastic job playing a Philadelphia born and egotistical neurosurgeon. From his work as Sherlock, we might have expected him to pull off the ego, but his performance was entirely different. His confidence, cockiness, and swagger was prominent to make a somewhat likable jerk who we quickly realize is not as likable as we had hoped. Cumberbatch showed fantastic vocal talent as well, throwing himself into an American accent.  His r’s are a little harsh and his ou’s might be a bit forced, but overall, it only adds to Strange’s commanding presence and eccentric personality.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41747 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-3-300x125.jpg" alt="unnamed-3" width="744" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-3-300x125.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-3-298x124.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-3-620x258.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-3.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /></p>
<p>That’s not to say the rest of the cast wasn’t as astounding as Cumberbatch. I didn’t recognize that dangerous Mads Mikkelsen as the villain Kaecilius or Rachel McAdams as the caring Christine Palmer. Their costumes and makeup were so well constructed that they appeared naturally a part of Strange’s world. Benedict Wong plays a larger and more discerning Wong than I expected, much to my delight, as the straight-man of the Strange-Wong duo. Chiwetel Ejiofor is a powerful actor as Mordo. He trains the soon-to-be-sorcerer in combat and brute magic while showing the utmost empathy for his friends. His emotional transition through the film moved me more than any other.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-41749 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-173x300.png" alt="unnamed" width="479" height="831" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-173x300.png 173w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-298x516.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed.png 471w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" /></p>
<p>On a final note, Tilda Swinton plays the controversial role of the Ancient One. Traditionally, the Ancient One has been a Tibetan monk older than a millenia. When Swinton was announced as the casting choice for the Ancient One, fans and hopefuls were quick to accuse the film of white washing. According to interviews by Radio Television Honk Kong (RTHK), a screenwriter has been quoted as saying the choice was a pragmatic one. If they were to cast a TIbetan as the Ancient One, the movie could be banned in China. Tilda Swinton and director Scott Derrickson say otherwise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing about it was pragmatic,&#8221; said Derrickson. &#8220;It was all creative, and that’s the honest truth. It was a decision that I made because in the comics, that character was a bit of a racist stereotype, and I was looking for a way to avoid that. And I first wanted to make it a woman. I also didn&#8217;t want to have it be a &#8220;Dragon Lady&#8221; kind of character which we’ve had a lot of in American cinema.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-41745 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-244x300.png" alt="unnamed-1" width="632" height="777" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-244x300.png 244w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1-298x366.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/unnamed-1.png 614w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /></p>
<p>Swinton added, &#8220;Scott Derrickson and Kevin Feige wanted to make a film that was entirely inclusive and diverse. And they didn’t want to include any stereotypes like, for example, the ancient Asian man or the ancient Asian woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can find the RTHK interview <a href="http://programme.rthk.hk/rthk/tv/programme.php?name=tv/theworks&amp;d=2016-11-02&amp;m=episode"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the YouTube equivalent </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo5swWZlR5s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Derrickson and Swinton hit on an interesting note. Asians have been exploited in American cinema since the era of Bruce Lee and, even moreso, in science fiction. William Gibson’s <em>The Man in the High Castle</em> doesn’t escape these stereotypes, forcing characters who don’t appear to have strong connections to Japan be forced by some ancient sense of duty to perform terrible deeds and punish others as well as themselves. The fascination of the unknown and vastly different cultures from Asia evolved into what some now call Techno-Orientalism.</p>
<p>To better break down the position Derrickson was in, let’s take a deeper look. In July 1963, the Ancient One appears in <em>Strange Tales #110</em>. He appeared as an old Asian man with mystical powers and magical knowledge while sporting a “Fu Manchu” mustache and beard. It was the time of the Vietnam War and acid. WWII was still a fresh memory and the focus on Asians as a threat to America had moved to Communism. It was a simpler time. A time when Mickey Rooney could appear in <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em> in yellowface and get a good laugh. Seductresses meant to thwart white heroes were called Dragon Ladies. And the Oriental Monk was becoming a fast stereotype.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41744 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Doctor-Strange-The-Oath-Mordo-196x300.png" alt="doctor-strange-the-oath-mordo" width="535" height="819" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Doctor-Strange-The-Oath-Mordo-196x300.png 196w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Doctor-Strange-The-Oath-Mordo-298x455.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" /></p>
<p>Jump forward forty years. Lucy Liu faces criticism for perpetuating stereotypes. She said, “when you are just starting out, you don’t have much choice about the roles you get to play” (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Asian-Mystique-Dragon-Ladies-Fantasies/dp/1586483943"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prasso, 2005</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p>So how does Derrickson escape this Harry Houdini of a trap? He decides to not include Wong, then relents. “I’m certainly not going to be the tea-making manservant,” <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/doctor-strange/41745/exclusive-benedict-wong-on-new-direction-of-his-doctor-strange-role">says British actor Benedict Wong</a>, “We’re heading in a different direction. He’s more of a drill sergeant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrickson <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/725894/Doctor-Strange-whitewashing-Tilda-Swinton-Ancient-One-Wong-Scott-Derrickson">said more on his choice</a> for casting Swinton, &#8220;Asians have been whitewashed and stereotyped in American cinema for over a century and people should be mad or nothing will change. What I did was the lesser of two evils, but it is still an evil. Plus we changed Mordo from white to black and I look at it all and think, &#8216;Yeah, I got that right.'&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Derrickson was put in a tough spot directing this film. There was no way for him to win. He plans to make Wong a more significant member of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He plans to keep hiring a diverse cast of actors. The only fault I see him at is hiring four British actors and a Danish actor as the heroes and villains with one American actor as the damsel in distress. But hey, it’s a freakin’ awesome movie. Go see it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, so we’ve got our motivation going.  Maybe you’ve done some research of your own in the past, looking into which workout system you’re going to choose. There are celebrity guides, sports guides, geeky guides, and even ones that say “just 15 minutes a day and you can lose 90 pounds”!  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, at least most are not wrong. Almost all workout guides will help with fitness and health goals. Almost every one of those guides will focus on one of three types of exercises: cardio, weight lifting, and interval training (HIIT).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe I should have labeled this post with NSFW, I just used </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">those </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">words&#8230;I’ve come to dread some of those words since I struggle with those workouts. I just don’t find them fun and I eventually give up my routines. I always feel like I’ve failed in my goals and I put my workouts on hiatus.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is very good science behind doing those types of workouts for exercise. Biking (cardio) will get you fit and lean. It will build muscle and trim fat. Lifting weights will increase your biceps and quads. It will also help you lose weight. Interval training can get you crazy ripped and ready for the beach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So&#8230;if all the science agrees that they’re good for you, what should you do? Well, if you are getting started and working out for your first time or even if it has been a while&#8230;you most likely will not be doing cardio like Sonic the Hedgehog, power-lifting like the Hulk, or doing HIIT like Little Mac.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The important thing is to move. All exercises require you to move, and that’s what burns the calories and gets your heart pounding. It&#8217;s what will build muscle and get you breathing hard. (By the way did you know that the way you lose the fat from the body is by breathing? The CO2 that you exhale is the metabolized fat escaping your body).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you are just getting started on your journey to become Lara Croft or Nathan Drake, start out doing a few simple movements:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk for 15 -30 minutes (go catch some Pokemon!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do 10 push-ups (against a wall/counter or even on your knees is fine)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do 10 squats (go down as far as you can go)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do a regular plank for 1 minute (if you need to do it in 15s intervals that’s fine)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do this three days a week it will help you start to build a workout routine. That is what we are going for. The goal right now is to start moving and if you keep moving (and depending upon how often you workout and what your personal goals are), you can get to power-lifting or running marathons soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the words of the ever fit guru, Richard Simmons: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Number one, like yourself. Number two, you have to eat healthy. And number three, you&#8217;ve got to squeeze your buns. That&#8217;s my formula.”</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41697 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multipass-300x158.jpg" alt="multipass" width="917" height="483" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multipass-300x158.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multipass-298x157.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multipass.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px" /></p>
<p>Oh boy.  I get to write about <em>The 5th Element</em>&#8230;I’ve waited for this moment all my life. Here we go. I LOVE this movie. I have it on Vudu and I watch it 2-3 times a week while doing laundry or cleaning. Let&#8217;s take this step by step. Grade A prime Bruce Willis, the reigning queen of kick butt, Milla Jovovich, and Chris Tucker in the roll he was born to play; one of the greatest characters ever conceived by any creative mind&#8230;ever. Supported by Gary Oldman as the obligatory villain out for personal profit, achieving his goals by any means necessary, and a big baddie that just wants to destroy everything. It takes place in the 23rd Century and sort of pokes fun at our cultural excesses, in a tongue in cheek sort of way, while delivering an excitingly paced action Sci-Fi thriller. How’s that for an elevator pitch?  Not good? Ok, let me gush some more.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41693 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Plavalaguna.jpg" alt="plavalaguna" width="728" height="452" /></p>
<p>Look, I’m aware it wasn’t ever going to win any awards, and even though I do believe Chris Tucker should have won an Oscar, the movie itself probably doesn’t belong in the conversation with other more prominent movies of the “Sci-Fi thriller” type genre. That being said, and begrudgingly admitted to by myself, why then, dear reader, CAN’T I STOP WATCHING IT?!?!  Oh, I’ll tell you why. Spoilerlessly….right now.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41695 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Leeloo-300x168.jpg" alt="leeloo" width="975" height="546" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Leeloo.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Leeloo-298x167.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></p>
<p>I’m sorry but, right off the bat, the movie lays the foundation for the larger plot of, “Hey, there is this ‘Great Evil’ that comes every 5,000 years and just wipes out all life with extreme prejudice. These mcguffins exist to defeat said Evil but first you must put them together correctly, figure out how to turn it on, and then you’ll be fine… piece of cake.” Right, but that story has been told thousands of times. Actually, you could probably argue that almost every adventure story ever written is based on that formula in some way or another. I don’t like arguing, so I’m not going to do that right now. What I will say is that some movies do it better than others and <em>The Fifth Element</em> does it pretty damn well.  It helps that Bruce Willis seems to be channeling futuristic space John Mcclane and Milla Jovovich is kicking butt as endearingly as ever.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41696 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zorg-300x168.jpg" alt="zorg" width="943" height="528" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zorg.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zorg-298x167.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px" /></p>
<p>I know, I’m gushing unabashedly, but I submit to you that a movie that keeps the action moving and making sure every scene advances the plot in some way is a recipe for success, no matter how much the acting and certain choreographically questionable choices leave the viewer wanting. There is a fight scene towards the end of the movie where Leeloo, Milla Jovovich&#8217;s character, takes on a bunch of alien mercenary bad guys and tunes them up.  This is juxtaposed cinematically with an impassioned Opera performance by an alien that has an important plot part to play. Parts of that fight don’t feel right, but in my always humble opinion, it works because the movie has kept moving forward from the get go. It’s run time is 2 hours and 7 minutes and every time I watch it, I think to myself that it’s too short. They don’t give you time to consider whether or not it’s a bad movie. They just give you the meat of the story in action sequences and short little character development scenes that perhaps never required incredible acting to pull of anyway. LEVITY my friends. As I mentioned before, <em>The Fifth Element</em> doesn’t appear to take itself too seriously and it shows. With comic relief around every corner book ended with suspenseful action that doesn’t ask you to worry too much about the outcome because it doesn’t hide the fact that in the end, love and light and goodness will win if willing to persevere. A subtle noble message presented in a very entertaining way.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41694 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ruby-300x168.jpg" alt="ruby" width="716" height="401" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ruby.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ruby-298x167.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" /></p>
<p>If you watch this movie for nothing else, please, PLEASE pay attention to Chris Tucker&#8217;s portrayal of the bombastic hyperbolic Ruby Rhod. I can’t emphasize enough that, if I had known about this movie when it came out, I would have been the chairman of the “Oscar for Chris Tucker” Academy lobbyist organization. I would have campaigned hard. From the moment he comes on the screen you just know… you just KNOW he is going to be a memorable character. I may be in the minority here, but in the history of cinema, I submit, that there has never been a fictional character portrayed better than Chris Tucker’s portrayal of Ruby Rhod. It’s an unnatural love, I know, but I love this character and I will scream it from the mountain tops if necessary. So, if anyone wants to re watch this classic, let me know, because I’m always down to watch, or just discuss the merits of <em>The Fifth Element</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Cosmere, the interconnected universe in which many of Brandon Sanderson&#8217;s fantasy books reside, has been <a href="http://www.tor.com/2016/10/27/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-universe-movie-rights-sold-to-dmg-entertainment/">licensed for film</a> with DMG Entertainment. The first in line to be adapted to film is the first book of the Stormlight Archives series, <em>The Way of Kings</em>, with screenwriters already being sought for the first Mistborn book, <em>The Final Empire</em>. While a licensing deal is no guarantee a film will see the light of day, as Sanderson&#8217;s peers <a href="http://www.tor.com/2013/07/18/patrick-rothfuss-name-of-the-wind-television-show/">Patrick Rothfuss</a> and <a href="http://variety.com/2006/film/features/hagemans-play-it-as-it-lies-1200339858/">Scott Lynch</a> can attest to, the deal is unique by the fact it is licensing a vast bibliography of books of multiple series rather than just one.</p>
<div id="attachment_41667" style="width: 735px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-41667" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sanderson-1-master675-300x200.jpg" alt="sanderson-1-master675" width="725" height="484" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sanderson-1-master675-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sanderson-1-master675-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sanderson-1-master675-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sanderson-1-master675.jpg 675w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Brandon Sanderson</p></div>
<p>Prepare your hearts, Sanderson fans, because adaptations come with sacrifices. Sanderson openly admits he is &#8220;<a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/01/22/writing-excuses-7-4-brevity/">not good at brevity</a>&#8220;, having written many books over four hundred pages long, with the hardcover first edition of The Way of Kings reaching a thousand and one pages. Two of the greatest hurdles for any adaptation of a book is time and money.  There may not be enough time to film your favorite scene or enough money in the budget to cast your favorite character. While films usually have bigger budgets than television, you can look to HBO’s <em>Game of Thrones</em> for a prime example of the kind of condensing that is likely to take place in order to keeping the running time low and within the budget.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-41675 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the_way_of_kings___cover_by_michael_whelan_by_arcanghell-d4ky8hl-1-300x188.jpg" alt="__the_way_of_kings___cover_by_michael_whelan_by_arcanghell-d4ky8hl" width="733" height="459" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the_way_of_kings___cover_by_michael_whelan_by_arcanghell-d4ky8hl-1-300x188.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the_way_of_kings___cover_by_michael_whelan_by_arcanghell-d4ky8hl-1-768x480.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the_way_of_kings___cover_by_michael_whelan_by_arcanghell-d4ky8hl-1-1200x750.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the_way_of_kings___cover_by_michael_whelan_by_arcanghell-d4ky8hl-1-298x186.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the_way_of_kings___cover_by_michael_whelan_by_arcanghell-d4ky8hl-1-620x388.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" /></p>
<p>Those are the pragmatic changes one can rationalize when watching an adaptation. This isn’t including the human factor. Though Sanderson makes it clear in the <em>Variety </em> article that DMG are fans of his work and while he is excited to work with them, it doesn’t give them the vision for the Cosmere as Sanderson. The written word is multifaceted. See any three different productions of any Shakespeare play for a proof. Then there are the screenwriters, the screenwriters who take another pass at the script afterwards, and the director who interprets  the screenplay. Oftentimes, when we’re talking about a movie, it is the director who we associate with the creative vision of the story. Corey Olsen, known by the moniker <a href="http://tolkienprofessor.com/about/professor-olsen/">The Tolkien Professor </a>, discussed this on his podcast on the subject of changes made to <em>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve often said a movie is different from a book. The first thing you have to keep in mind when you are going to see a film adaptation of a book is you&#8217;re not going to see a book on screen and it&#8217;s not fair to evaluate the thing you are seeing as if it were simply a transposition of the book on screen. It&#8217;s not a translation. It&#8217;s an adaptation. It&#8217;s a retelling. This is another version of the story. This is not Tolkien. This is Peter Jackson&#8217;s retelling of Tolkien&#8217;s story on screen and those are two different thing. You have a different person telling the story and you have a different medium in which the story is being told.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.mythgard.org/2013/01/tolkien-chat-12-adaptation-and-the-hobbit-movies/">Tolkien Chat 12: Adaptation and the Hobbit Movies</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>So we’ve prepared ourselves for change. The book isn’t going away. It is still there, sitting on our shelf or stored on our eBook library. With the negative out of the way, we can move on to the positive parts of this deal. A film version of <em>The Way of Kings</em> has the opportunity to bring epic fantasy books that are not Middle-Earth back into theaters. The majority of current sci-fi and fantasy films being adapted from books fall into the genre of Young Adult such as <em>The Maze Runner</em>, <em>The Divergent</em> series, and <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>, with epic fantasy series like <em>Game of Thrones</em>, <em>American Gods</em>, and the <em>Shannara Chronicles</em> finding homes on television. With Stephen King’s <em>The Dark Tower</em> and Sanderson’s <em>The Way of Kings </em>coming to theaters, this may open a gateway for new and diverse fantasy films.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-41672 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Vin-by-miranda-meeks-web-768x1190-194x300.jpg" alt="vin-by-miranda-meeks-web-768x1190" width="378" height="585" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Vin-by-miranda-meeks-web-768x1190-194x300.jpg 194w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Vin-by-miranda-meeks-web-768x1190.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Vin-by-miranda-meeks-web-768x1190-298x462.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Vin-by-miranda-meeks-web-768x1190-620x961.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></p>
<p>Diversity in film is another hot button topic <em>The Way of Kings</em> may bring some positivity to. Roshar, the planet in which <em>The Stormlight Archives</em> takes place is rich with different cultures. Sanderson takes great pride in his worldbuilding, filling Roshar with people of many diverse ethnicities and cultures.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41671 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the_people_OF_ROSHAR-300x253.jpg" alt="the_people_of_roshar" width="755" height="637" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the_people_OF_ROSHAR-300x253.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the_people_OF_ROSHAR-298x251.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the_people_OF_ROSHAR.jpg 564w" sizes="(max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px" /></p>
<p>This leaves an opportunity for diverse casting. Sanderson, replying to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/4shyds/no_spoilers_til_that_the_people_who_live_in/d59u6fo/"> thread on Reddit</a>, describes the Alethi, who fill out a large portion of the main cast so far, as being modeled by “half-asian / half-arab or half-asian / half-polynesian” people. To us, Alethi “look like a race you can’t define” because “we don’t have them on earth.” This strays from the beaten path of fantasy being based upon Europe in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>You can let out a sigh of relief if you’re worried about the the films catching up to the books before they finish releasing. There are already ten novels released within the Cosmere universe as well as short stories, novelettes, novellas, and graphic novels. Once <em>The Way of Kings</em> film is released, the next in line can be the first <em>Mistborn </em> book rather than jumping straight to <em>Words of Radiance</em>. If extenuating circumstance delay both a second <em>Stormlight Archives</em> and a second <em>Mistborn </em> film there are currently three other books in Cosmere, Elantris, Warbreaker, and White Sand, to fall back on. The other part that will put your mind at ease, as his fans and his peers will reassure you, is Sanderson is an exceptionally quick writer. His original goal for the <em> Stormlight Archive </em> was “one book every eighteen months” which is extraordinarily fast for a thousand page epic fantasy novel but even when that outcome <a href="http://brandonsanderson.com/state-of-the-sanderson-2015/"> began to look unachieveable </a> the third book, currently titled by the author <em>Oathbringer</em>, will arrive two and half years after the second. Part of what has endured his fans to Mr. Sanderson has been his upfront nature about the publication dates of his books.</p>
<p>So the bad news are that a licensing deal is no guarantee these movies will ever see the light of day, change is inevitable before it even begins production, and the people involved may have a completely different vision for the story than readers have always imagined. It’s fine. Sanderfans have prepared themselves. On the brightside, this a great opportunity to bring the epic storytelling and worldbuilding back to movies, cast a diverse group of actors and actresses, and the likelihood of the movies overtaking the books is relatively small. Here’s hoping more news is inbound in the near future and this is only the beginning for other fantasy novels to be brought to the theater.</p>

<p>I am a one game kind of guy. For whatever complex psychological reason I still, after all these years, prefer to only play one game at a time. I have recently had to break that rule when it comes to <em>Dark Souls</em>. Because yes, like most others, I find <em>Dark Souls</em> to be very, very hard and if I were to stick to my one game at a time rule, I would never get to play anything else. I have played video games nearly all my life and I don’t hesitate to admit that I am awful at <em>Dark Souls</em>. I die all the time. I swear. I curse. I throw things. I promise to the old gods and the new that I will never grace this game with another moment of my precious time.</p>

<p>I am now on my second playthrough on new game+ and have just bought a PS4 just so I can co-op <em>Dark Souls 1</em> with a friend. I love it. It’s now 5 years old, but I can’t help but recommend it to as many people as I can. But, it’s horrifically difficult to actually ‘get into’, to look past that first couple hundred death screens and see the game for the complex, blood soaked beauty that it is. So Geekly is here to help with this handy guide to getting your toes wet in the first <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41635" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Get-Used.png" alt="get-used" width="3508" height="735" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Get-Used.png 3508w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Get-Used-300x63.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Get-Used-768x161.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Get-Used-1200x251.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Get-Used-298x62.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Get-Used-620x130.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 3508px) 100vw, 3508px" /></p>
<div id="attachment_41648" style="width: 1110px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-41648" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-2.jpg" alt="A Screen That I Know And Love" width="1100" height="619" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-2.jpg 1100w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-2-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-2-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-2-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-2-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A Screen That I Know And Love</p></div>
<p>It almost seems like a cliché to say it at this point, but you will die a lot in <em>Dark Souls</em>. In fact, genuine research has shown that your actual number of deaths in any given game with exceed your expectations by a factor of at least 8.</p>
<p>Now, this is not a bad thing. No really, it isn’t. Death is the game&#8217;s way of keeping you humble, and there’s a good chance that if you died, it was entirely your own fault. <em>Dark Souls</em> is not in the habit of hand-holding, or even really holding on to any part of you. The game respects you and your choices as a functioning adult. And this is perhaps the core of the game, and potentially the biggest hurdle to truly enjoying it. There is a freedom to the game that others don’t particularly have. While you of course have the freedom to succeed however you like (and indeed can), you are also free to fail however you like. This freedom can be distressing, confusing even, and indeed can lead to many, many repeated deaths.</p>
<div id="attachment_41649" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-41649 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-3.jpg" alt="You Can Go Whichever Way You Like, But Only One Way Is Safe" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-3.jpg 1920w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-3-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-3-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-3-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-3-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-3-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">You Can Go Whichever Way You Like, But Only One Way Is Safe</p></div>
<p>The key point is to remember that death is not a point of failure in <em>Dark Souls</em>, rather, it’s a key part of the experience. And that leads to the next point.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41636" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/All-Roads.png" alt="all-roads" width="3508" height="735" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/All-Roads.png 3508w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/All-Roads-300x63.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/All-Roads-768x161.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/All-Roads-1200x251.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/All-Roads-298x62.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/All-Roads-620x130.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 3508px) 100vw, 3508px" /></p>
<p>If you’re tackling <em>Dark Souls</em> and find yourself dying, it’s not because the game is a piece of bullshit and it hates you. It’s not even necessarily because you’re bad at the game. It may be because you’re on the wrong path, both strategically or quite literally. Thanks to the game’s aforementioned freedom, you have the full ability to go wherever you please and try whatever character strategies, weapons and spells you like. But just because you <em>can </em>do something does not make it a good idea.</p>
<div id="attachment_41650" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-41650 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-4.jpg" alt="picture-4" width="490" height="276" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-4.jpg 490w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-4-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture-4-298x168.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A Legitimate Strategy, But Perhaps Not The Wisest</p></div>
<p>While a certain amount of persistence is required, it is important to remember that alternative strategies are 100% viable and in some cases needed. While you may really enjoy that sword you’ve got that does poison damage, it’s just a fact that eventually <em>something </em>is going to have poison resistance. Equally, if you keep dying in the graveyard, maybe you’re just not ready for it.</p>
<p>Explore, try new things and of course…</p>

<p><em>Dark Souls </em>is a video game. I’m not saying that in a philosophical ‘don’t worry go do something else’ sense, I’m saying <em>Dark Souls </em>is much more concerned with fun than anything else. When the time comes to make your choice in terms of class, it only matters for the first 20 minutes of the game. After that you’re free to do whatever you like. Started as a fighter with a big axe but now you’d like to be a mage? Spend souls on a few levels, up your intelligence and try it out. Worst comes to worst, just start a new game. The first asylum isn’t that hard, right?</p>

<p>Experimenting is great. But spreading your stats too thin can really screw you over later in the game. Or early in the game. In fact you can get screwed over at any point regardless of your stats. But I digress. It’s a good idea to, eventually, decide how you’d like to play the game. Like swinging those big swords? Up your strength, vitality and endurance and keep at it. Looking to parry some hoes with that sweet shield you picked up? Keep parrying, invest in strength. Want to bless the world with your miracles? Keep at it in faith, but don’t neglect your weapons. Whatever it is that you decide, stay strong with it, you can always play the game again.</p>

<p>Quite a lot oddly enough. Have a quick breakdown.</p>
<div id="attachment_41654" style="width: 3518px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-41654" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/STATS.png" alt="All Descriptions Lifted Straight From The Game" width="3508" height="1361" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/STATS.png 3508w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/STATS-300x116.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/STATS-768x298.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/STATS-1200x466.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/STATS-298x116.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/STATS-620x241.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 3508px) 100vw, 3508px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">All Descriptions Lifted Straight From The Game</p></div>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41642" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Best-one.png" alt="best-one" width="3508" height="735" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Best-one.png 3508w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Best-one-300x63.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Best-one-768x161.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Best-one-1200x251.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Best-one-298x62.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Best-one-620x130.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 3508px) 100vw, 3508px" /></p>
<p>Well, none of them really. It all depends on how you want to play the game.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41643" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Seriously.png" alt="seriously" width="3508" height="735" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Seriously.png 3508w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Seriously-300x63.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Seriously-768x161.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Seriously-1200x251.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Seriously-298x62.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Seriously-620x130.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 3508px) 100vw, 3508px" /></p>
<p>Okay, you got me. Maybe, maybe, some of them are more important than others. Hands down the simplest and easiest build is one centered around strength and endurance. Carrying a big sword, maybe some light armor, and focusing on getting those big hits in. But of course if you’re more about those spells, maybe you don’t want high strength? So, you bump your intelligence. But what else? Well, really, two of the biggest stats that you’ll need to keep an eye on are Vitality and Endurance. Vitality because, y’know, everyone needs more health. You can quickly find yourself being outstripped in terms of your total health and the damage that enemies now do when you move into a new area. So, while you’re cranking that strength or intelligence or dexterity, keep an eye on your vitality.</p>
<p>Perhaps more key to your continued success is your endurance. While of course a higher endurance lets you carry and equip more stuff, it has a deeper, far more useful function. It lets you roll. It lets you swing your sword, cast your spells and generally do more and more things. And you want to do more things. When your endurance hits zero, you’re stuck. And when you’re doing the pointy tango with a Black Knight, having just enough endurance to execute one more roll can literally mean the difference between life and death. So, while you may stop with the endurance when you can carry all your equipment, don’t be afraid to pop in a few more points.</p>
<p>And that leads to our next point</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41645" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Eyes-and-Ears.png" alt="eyes-and-ears" width="3508" height="735" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Eyes-and-Ears.png 3508w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Eyes-and-Ears-300x63.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Eyes-and-Ears-768x161.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Eyes-and-Ears-1200x251.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Eyes-and-Ears-298x62.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Eyes-and-Ears-620x130.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 3508px) 100vw, 3508px" /></p>
<p><em>Dark Souls </em>gives you a lot of freedom. If you disrespect that, it will punish you. If you run blindly into an area, expecting nothing but success and rainbows, you will find the opposite. It is incredibly important to remember to stay alert. Lordran is a dangerous world. Every single NPC you meet will express deep, profound surprise at you having lived through, well, anything. And there is a reason for that. The chief amongst those is that even a simple stone hallway can be dangerous to your health.</p>

<p>Check your health when its quiet. Make sure things are <em>actually</em> quiet. And when you fight, keep an eye on your surroundings and keep the other eye on your stamina bar. If it sounds like a tiny bit of work, that’s because it is. But succeeding in a difficult portion of the game due to almost entirely your own efforts and sheer skill? Undeniably satisfying.</p>
<p>Know what else is satisfying?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41646" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dat-Lore.png" alt="dat-lore" width="3508" height="399" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dat-Lore.png 3508w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dat-Lore-300x34.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dat-Lore-768x87.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dat-Lore-1200x136.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dat-Lore-298x34.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dat-Lore-620x71.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 3508px) 100vw, 3508px" /></p>
<p><em>Dark Souls</em>, at first glance, makes no sense. Heck, even at second glance it makes no sense. But underneath the difficulty, dark atmosphere and punishing game-play is an incredibly rich and interesting story. Lordran is a world with a long and varied history. None of which will ever be spoon-fed to you by the game. While it may be satisfying to execute a perfect roll and a parry, it’s equally as satisfying to discover some unknown portion of the world, or connect a seemingly random item you found to an enemy or an npc. There is a deep satisfaction to finding these hidden gems and, more so than any other game, I have found myself going ‘ah-hah!’ aloud to myself.</p>

<p>Stories abound about<em> Dark Souls</em>&#8216; difficulty and how merciless it is. But looking past all of that, there&#8217;s a great game waiting to be discovered. There’s so much more to it than crushing defeat and unending deaths. If, you’re willing to push though frustration and bouts of swearing you will be treated to one of the best gaming experiences currently available.</p>
<p>Anyone looking to engage in a little bit of jolly cooperation in <em>Dark Souls</em> (any of them), or looking for some advice, or even just a chat, hit me up on twitter! I’m @mrk_bennett and I’m always happy to share in your Black Knight conquests, or even just commiserate and sympathize about the Tauros Demon.</p>

<p>Our heroes make their way back to Norhall, but soon find out that everything is a test! What were considered simple tasks are now moments of scrutiny and anxiety. What if they get a bad grade? What if someone is&#8230;disappointed? The horror! Luckily, the gang starts to make more friends around Norhall so they shouldn&#8217;t look like huge dorks for the Harvest Festival Dance. That is a good thing, at least.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello fellow Heroes!</p>
<p>Blizzcon 2016 is in full force today and Blizzard just announced the newest character to join the heroes of Overwatch, Sombra. What we know right now, based off her introduction video, is that; she may work for &#8220;the bad guys&#8221; but she doesn&#8217;t seem bad herself, she is a hacker that can potentially have the power to &#8220;shut down&#8221; or control electronic devices/other characters (just how has not been released yet). Additionally Sombra was shown teleporting to her own personal teleporter and using a sub-machine gun. More importantly she can turn invisible. Sombra looks like an amazing new edition to the Overwatch team and we can&#8217;t wait until November 8th when she is added to the PTR!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE!</strong> <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/sombra/">Sombra&#8217;s overview</a> in live on the Overwatch site! I am already weeping for Reinhardt&#8217;s shield.</p>
<p>Watch the Sombra&#8217;s introduction video below and let us know what you think about the world&#8217;s newest hero!</p>

<div class="video"><iframe width="620" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Og5-Pm4HNlI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2!</strong> From the Blizzcon Overwatch: What&#8217;s New Panel we got a chance to see a concept of Sombra&#8217;s alternative skin. It is still concept art, so who knows what it will look like in game, but it is pretty rad!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41659 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-04b-300x224.jpg" alt="2016-11-04b" width="735" height="549" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-04b-300x224.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-04b-768x574.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-04b-1200x897.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-04b-298x223.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-04b-620x463.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-04b.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /></p>
<p>I have a hard time motivating myself to do things sometimes. Take out the trash, clean the dishes, fold the laundry, go grocery shopping….working out. There always seems to be something in the way. One day, traffic really sucked and drained my energy. Another day, my toddler was acting up while our 8 month old is really needy and doesn’t want to be put down. Maybe I’d rather spend time with the wife relaxing and watching Netflix or Hulu.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is this: I’m not motivated at times to actually get my ass off of the couch. For the majority of people, ranging from underweight to overweight, the true issue is motivation. I have seen some incredible transformations from people who were 400 lbs and lost 200 lbs and there are success stories from the 90 lbs person gaining 60 lbs of muscle. All it took for them to get off of the couch/desk/bed was <em>motivation</em>.</p>
<p>My motivation varies from day to day but it always revolves around two different types: personal and external. I want to be stronger, more flexible, and healthier for myself. I don’t like having love handles or not being able to lift a couch to help someone move, so I build strength and try to eat right. I want to be better for my kids and wife. I plan on teaching my daughters some martial arts but how can I justify telling them to run or do push-ups when I can’t myself.</p>
<p>Every person’s motivations are deeply personal and range from being vain to selfless. But the bottom line is that your motivation will get you moving and eating better. It will lead you to do some incredible things, feats of endurance and strength that you never would have thought possible.</p>
<p>Some of the ways to create your own motivation can be to make your goal work for you and to make missing your goal work against you. For example:  every time you eat a salad, give yourself $5 towards a new board game, but if you eat a doughnut, remove $5. This will give you an incentive to eat healthy but taking the less healthy choice will negatively impact you outside of your goals.</p>
<p>Another way is to make it a part of your daily life. Three years ago I decided to challenge myself and do 100 push-ups everyday for one year. I didn’t succeed (technically). There were a few days that I had to do my push-ups in the morning then again at night. But I finished 36,500 for the year. I made it a schedule, before bed I closed down the house, scooped the litter, exercised then played some games or watched Netflix with my wife. Now I schedule a workout three times a week after my kids go to sleep, I give myself two cheat days where I can eat what I want (within reason), and have a beer or hard liquor on the weekends.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can motivate yourself by being held accountable to someone else. The closer and more often you see each other the better. Working out or eating healthier is always better with a buddy. They can help push you to do one more lap or choose to have the low-fat option.</p>
<p>Finding your motivation and keeping to it can feel like work but if you want to improve yourself, know that more often it is a fun and rewarding experience. Make your nerdiness work for you. Learn everything and research as much as you can about how to cook better (molecular gastronomy is for you), what muscles are engaged when you do a squat (physiology is for you). When you make it a habit, routine and a game, you are far more likely to stick with a diet or workout program than if you consider it a chore or something that you have to do. So regardless of what you decide, know that I’ll be here rooting for you to push yourself for one more mile, or just one more home cooked meal during the week!</p>

<p>(I make no apologies for the alliteration, and neither does Seanan McGuire.)</p>
<p>You would have to try pretty hard to not enjoy a Seanan McGuire novel. She&#8217;s just such a good writer, so assured that the story just flows and flows. So too does the mythology, a world of witches who have affinities for many more things than the classical elements of wind and fire and so on. There are rat witches and steel witches and corn witches, and all of them know a secret or two about ghosts. That&#8217;s because ghosts likewise participate in a mythos far from the standard necromantic tragedies or scare tactics.</p>
<p>Ghosts here are examinations of what it really means to have &#8220;unfinished&#8221; business. So often what is unfinished is either a message of love or vengeance, but what if what goes unfinished is much simpler&#8211;the extra/ordinary acts of living and working in the world? For McGuire, ghosts arise when people die before their time. The accidents, the suicides, the murders and so on&#8211;some of them aren&#8217;t &#8220;part of the plan,&#8221; as insensitive greeting cards and distant relatives are so fond of saying. And that is a very nice model for a story, one that gives a great deal of agency to human beings but also has a system in place to right those wrongs. When you die before your time, you get to come back. You get to interact with the world mostly as you did when you were alive&#8211;which means you can keep making the same mistakes or you can grow, change, move.</p>
<p><i>Dusk or Dark or Dawn or Day</i> is also a wistful look at the perils and promises of moving from a small town to a big city. We don&#8217;t lose our roots&#8211;certainly Jenna doesn&#8217;t, the way her Kentucky hometown of Mill Hollow pulls at her regardless of where she goes&#8211;but we do lose something, all in proportion to what we gain. <i>What</i> these transactions entail is ill-defined both to the traveler and the audience, but it remains affecting. The novella has a profound sense of nostalgia, not for a time or a place, but for feelings themselves: big, overwhelming feelings like Home and Hope and Promise, all the things that get tarnished after childhood. The process of earning these feelings back&#8211;or not&#8211;is messy and difficult. Especially for Jenna, who lost her sister and then lost her own life and isn&#8217;t sure where or how to pick up where everything left off.</p>
<p>Jenna has moved all the way to Manhattan, following her sister&#8217;s doomed footsteps in order to exorcise her ghost, if you&#8217;ll pardon the expression. Because Jenna is haunted more than she haunts, forever wondering about her sister&#8217;s suicide and the time leading up to it. Since her sister, Patty, isn&#8217;t a ghost, it was certainly her time. But that doesn&#8217;t stop Jenna from taking a job at the suicide hotline to try to keep others alive, night after night and minute after minute. She keeps meticulous track, in fact, because of the other power of ghosts is to play with that time they missed out on, for good or bad.</p>
<p>Ghosts absorb time from others and take it for themselves (if they want), getting them closer to their &#8220;dying day&#8221; &#8211; but they can also give that time back to punish people, making the living older and the ghosts &#8220;younger.&#8221; They act as anchors to time and the world, evening out the flow, a kind of collective temporal karma.</p>
<p>Or they would, if all the ghosts in New York City hadn&#8217;t abruptly disappeared. Who&#8211;or what&#8211;is behind this sudden absence and silence? And why? Only Jenna can answer that question, but to do so she&#8217;ll have to confront her own (metaphorical) ghosts, the revenants of home and memory she&#8217;s tried so hard to block out.</p>
<p>The mystery is compelling, but it&#8217;s not the heart of this story. The heart is connection to time and place and people, and it&#8217;s brimful of melancholic beauty. What does it mean, in the end, to save or be saved, to haunt or be haunted? The characters here lively, living metaphors, even if they aren&#8217;t all, strictly speaking, alive, and they have a lot to say on the topic of living well.</p>

<p><em>Shin Godzilla</em> makes a hard pivot from the last 10 years of Godzilla material, which tried to recast Godzilla as some kind of force-of-nature antihero. Now he’s back to being a very mean, angry metaphor of modern Japanese fears and frustrations. If you’re a hardcore Godzilla fan, that’s great! You’ve probably seen this movie and are waiting for the Blu-Ray. If you’re looking for some city destruction porn, stick to Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla (2014). For everyone else, expect an interesting but flawed take on a “realistic” Kaiju movie.</p>
<p><em>Shin Godzilla</em> begins when a torrent of hot steam and raging water erupts out of Tokyo bay. The Japanese government responds to the situation by forming committees. Then forming subcommittees. Then forming sub-subcommittees to argue about the issue only to  conclude that they need more info. The satire is on the nose but it’s definitely sharp. One politician named Rando Yaguchi, portrayed by Hiroki Hasegawa, believes this unnatural phenomenon is the some kind of creature. High ranking staff laugh him out out of an early meeting for suggesting such nonsense. He is immediately vindicated when a giant tail emerges from the water. He’s given special jurisdiction over the situation when his theory proves true. He forms a dedicated team to tackle the issue, thus beginning a race to fix the Godzilla problem before the monster or international politics wreak more havoc in Tokyo.</p>
<div id="attachment_41604" style="width: 695px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-41604" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/download-300x162.jpg" alt="download" width="685" height="370" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/download-300x162.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/download-298x161.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/download.jpg 306w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Water we even looking at here? Thanks Geekly for publishing my content on your webzone. It can only go up from here.</p></div>
<p>Being the first Godzilla film from Toho in 12 years, the studio has given director Hideaki Anno and his team major creative leeway. Godzilla&#8217;s design is about as frightening as you could make him in 2016. The team has updated his look to make him more like a drooping, hideous zombie version of the beloved Kaiju (which, if you think hard enough about, might be some kind of meta commentary on the franchise).</p>
<p>Anno, his co-director, Shinji Higuchi, and their team give Godzilla an unnerving lilt to it’s movement. There&#8217;s not a load of destruction in the film; about a fifth of the runtime is old school city destruction. But there are a few set pieces that are inventive, fun, and even chilling at times. The final shot of Godzilla, a monster famous for being a clunky rubber suit, sends shivers  down your spine. That being said, ignore some of the 2005 looking CG in the film and appreciate Godzilla&#8217;s new look. It&#8217;s for the best.</p>
<div id="attachment_41605" style="width: 714px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-41605" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ShinGodzilla_16-300x162.jpg" alt="Don’t worry, Godzilla is actually much bigger than this Helicopter. " width="704" height="380" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ShinGodzilla_16-300x162.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ShinGodzilla_16-768x415.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ShinGodzilla_16-298x161.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ShinGodzilla_16-620x335.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ShinGodzilla_16.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Don’t worry, Godzilla is actually much bigger than these helicopters.</p></div>
<p>So Godzilla looks great, but what about the  rest of the film? It&#8217;s good, not great. The film is made up of boardroom scenes, research meetings, and politicians yelling at each other. It&#8217;s some good old fashioned Japanese melodrama mixed in with satire.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of Anno&#8217;s editing and shot composition in <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, expect plenty of his style. The man loves focusing on household objects, trailing the camera off his subjects, and filming a scene at any angle. It&#8217;s compelling visually, until it starts to get bogged down in the second act, like much of the second act.</p>
<p><em>Shin Godzilla</em> has some major pacing issues during the halfway mark. At its worst, the movie felt like scenes edited down from a TV show. Characters also love coming to grand conclusions based on some tertiary evidence. Even for a fan of anime logic BS like me, the film loses some logical coherence. Some of the acting also feels &#8220;daytime television.&#8221; There&#8217;s been some discourse surrounding a &#8220;Japanese American Diplomat&#8221; that will have to be seen to be believed. If you&#8217;re a fan of B Movie schlock, you may enjoy her work.</p>
<p>The film is not perfect, but it wears it&#8217;s big, radioactive heart on its sleeve. It&#8217;s not afraid to be as Japanese as possible, tackling hard Japanese societal and political issues that will leave American scratching their heads. Part of the fun is seeing how America is portrayed in the film. It&#8217;s an extremely specific film that&#8217;s much more interesting than Hollywood&#8217;s broad take on the creature. Check it out when it hits Blu-Ray and VOD soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should be playing board games! Luckily I can help you meet this goal very very easily. I live and breathe board games; oh and my name is Jordan Maday, but that fact is secondary to the board games. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now there are still some people whose minds instantly fall on <em>Monopoly </em>or <em>Sorry </em>when they think about board games. While these games can be fun in the right times of life; there is so much more out there. Luckily I am here to recommend hundreds upon hundreds of hobby board games to you. I am here to be your guide I will always be here to play games with, and help choose dozens more to add to your collections. I adore board games, and even more so I adore introducing people to this incredibly rewarding hobby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly though I have partaken of and engaged with the GeeklyInc community for several years now, and I hope to allow you all to get to know me as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I begin my life&#8217;s work, getting as many people to play as many games as possible, and what better way to do so than to recommend three of my favorite games guaranteed to provide hours of fun! If you love games as much as me you&#8217;ve probably heard of all these, and in that case this article can serve as a reminder to bring one of these games back to the table. Now that the introductions are out of the way let&#8217;s take a look!</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41614" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/600full-letters-from-whitechapel-cover.jpg" alt="600full-letters-from-whitechapel-cover" width="600" height="600" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/600full-letters-from-whitechapel-cover.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/600full-letters-from-whitechapel-cover-150x150.jpg 150w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/600full-letters-from-whitechapel-cover-300x300.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/600full-letters-from-whitechapel-cover-180x180.jpg 180w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/600full-letters-from-whitechapel-cover-75x75.jpg 75w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/600full-letters-from-whitechapel-cover-298x298.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first there is no gaming genre I enjoy more than hidden movement/deduction game. For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with the genre, they are generally games in which several players move around a board trying to find another player whose movements are obscured and whose only objective is to escape his pursuers.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_41616" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-41616" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSCF1765-e1424402700259-1200x900.jpg" alt="The inspectors are hard at work searching for history's greatest murderer." width="620" height="465" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSCF1765-e1424402700259-1200x900.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSCF1765-e1424402700259-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSCF1765-e1424402700259-768x576.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSCF1765-e1424402700259-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSCF1765-e1424402700259-620x465.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSCF1765-e1424402700259.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The inspectors are hard at work searching for history&#8217;s greatest murderer.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In no game is this more distilled to its basest pulse pounding simplicity than in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letters From Whitechapel</span></em><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A thematically engrossing game where one player takes on the murderous role as Jack the Ripper and up to five of his friends are set as police inspectors. These men and women of the law have the grim task of hunting Jack down through the grime soaked alleys of London’s Whitechapel District.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are looking for a brain burning game bereft of random elements; a game which is won by the keen of mind and the most cunning strategist, look no further than this gem of a game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another gaming tradition I can&#8217;t help but fall in love with is the dungeon crawl. Starting my geeky tenure as a Tabletop RPG player I am always looking to the dungeon crawl as a bit of Methadone when missing D&amp;D sessions. Of all the dungeon crawlers you will be hard pressed to find one bursting with so much personality or cuteness as one </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mice and Mystics</span></em><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41619" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image3-thumb-450x300-78507.jpg" alt="image3-thumb-450x300-78507" width="450" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image3-thumb-450x300-78507.jpg 450w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image3-thumb-450x300-78507-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image3-thumb-450x300-78507-298x199.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" />In this cooperative experience one to four players will take control of adorable little mice traveling around a castle attempting to quell the dark forces residing within. Outfitting themselves with a button or a thimble for defense these brave mice will put many a centipede or rat to the sword while avoiding Brodie, the dastardly feline resident of the castle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fans of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redwall</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mouse Guard</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> properties will instantly recognize this aesthetic and should be kicking themselves if they have somehow missed this game. Gather up some of your friends or even some young ones for this perfect little dungeon crawler that&#8217;s fun for the whole family.</span></p>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/battlestar-galactica/">Battlestar Galactica</a></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>(<a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/">Fantasy Flight Games</a>)</strong><b><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41620" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/thumbnail.jpeg" alt="thumbnail" width="499" height="500" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/thumbnail.jpeg 499w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/thumbnail-150x150.jpeg 150w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/thumbnail-300x300.jpeg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/thumbnail-180x180.jpeg 180w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/thumbnail-75x75.jpeg 75w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/thumbnail-298x299.jpeg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now first things first, I have never seen a single frame of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Battlestar Galactica</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I can assure you that this game does not require foreknowledge of the series to enjoy, but I can only imagine it would help. Nonetheless this cooperative game has the honor of being the first hobby game I had ever played and I immediately fell in love.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_41621" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-41621" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5762033403_a974f1858d_z.jpg" alt="All the ships humanity could muster" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5762033403_a974f1858d_z.jpg 640w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5762033403_a974f1858d_z-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5762033403_a974f1858d_z-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5762033403_a974f1858d_z-620x465.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">All the ships humanity could muster</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I believe this game has been covered here on GeeklyInc before but if you passed over it then you owe it to yourself to try this one out!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three to six players will be tasks of crew members of the</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Battlestar Galactica </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">doing their best to defend against the robotic threat of the Cylons and maintaining the ship&#8217;s food, morale, and other resources on the starships search for a planet to land on. This already difficult task is complicated further by the possibility and eventual certainty that several of the players will be traitorous Cylons disguised as humans. The job of these treasonous toasters is to make sure the Galactica’s mission fails by whatever means possible; be it subterfuge or all out attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This game can be a little more complex than my other recommendations, but if you are looking for a deep and challenging experience that will put friendships to the test; look no further than this blast of a game.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And those are a couple of my baseline recommendations. If you have never played or have simply neglected these titles, I heartily recommend you look into them.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-41590 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/42321-1-300x225.jpg" alt="42321-1" width="668" height="501" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/42321-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/42321-1.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/42321-1-298x224.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></p>
<p>I thought when I picked up a copy of <i>The Thousandth Floor</i> I was basically going to a vending machine to get some brief, brightly colored enjoyment that might make me feel slightly gross but overall do very little. Instead, I got this rich, deliciously indulgent treat of a book. It&#8217;s glitzy and gutsy in the best ways, all that sweet, sweet intrigue resting atop some genuinely bittersweet motivations, making all of the characters seem real and relatable.</p>
<p>Well, mostly. It <i>is</i> easy to relate to Avery&#8217;s hopeless pining for her crush, but less easy to relate to her life of total privilege, occupying the unbelievably grand top floor of the miles-high skyscraper. Few of us reading this live such lives of overwhelming advantage, and the story enhances the magnitude of that advantage with its 22nd century setting, adding hovercars and anti-grav yoga and a host of other little details to make it feel even more overwhelming&#8211;and even further out of reach.</p>
<p>And inhabiting this world of technologically-induced bliss? Teenagers, naturally. Crafted at the genetic level, surgically enhanced, and unfailingly encouraged to craft themselves into the most perfect versions of themselves, these young men and women are disciples of wealth. Wealth, but not ease. They aren&#8217;t cyborgs; this isn&#8217;t a dystopian commentary on computers (well, maybe a little bit&#8211;there is an AI). They have to work to sculpt their bodies, to learn what they need to know, and to stay on the razor-sharp cutting edge of their social world, which exists at the top of the Tower.</p>
<p>Does this seem like a nest of Versace vipers, all feeding off each other&#8217;s poison? Well, yes and no. It&#8217;s deliciously scandalous and the characters can be vicious, but they&#8217;re vicious in the way that teenagers can be, lashing out in part or in whole because they are uncertain about themselves and their place in the world. Moreover, the rich kids aren&#8217;t the only ones who have a voice. There&#8217;s also Watt&#8211;Watzhan Bakradi&#8211;the child of immigrants and a genius computer programmer-turned-hacker who lives way down on the lower floors. Below even him is Rylin, a high school dropout who&#8217;s trying to support her younger sister and a partying habit in the wake of their mother&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>The Tower is New York, what New York has become. Miles high, its base is all of Manhattan and its top is a single suite nestled in the clouds. It&#8217;s a very literal interpretation of the economic ladder, with the poorest at the bottom and the wealthiest at the top. But just because it&#8217;s basic doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s obvious or trite. It&#8217;s quite clever, and gets all the more interesting when we see how those upper-Tower worlds come crashing into middle- and lower-Tower people who have none of the beautiful advantages of their lofty peers.</p>
<p>But the lower&#8211;literally&#8211;class characters aren&#8217;t <i>apart</i> from the rest of the narrative. They aren&#8217;t sainted Lessons to their richer-but-morally-poor neighbors (God how I hate that trope); they aren&#8217;t ne&#8217;er do wells who deserve their status, either. This is a story that contains privilege but isn&#8217;t <i>about</i> privilege. It&#8217;s about its characters, plain and simple, and that&#8217;s how a good book should be.</p>
<p><i>The Thousandth Floor</i> has profound compassion for its characters while also not letting them off the hook. Eris is spoiled and self-indulgent and it makes her oblivious to others&#8217; feelings&#8211;until a secret undoes her entire life and forces her to start over with everyone she knows. Leda is suffering from the pangs of addiction and heartbreak, but while her secrecy and desperation is understandable, it doesn&#8217;t get her a free pass from either the other characters or the narrative. Her brittleness only starts to show more and more cracks, but she doesn&#8217;t only expose herself. She&#8217;s also trying to expose her best friend-turned-stranger Avery, who is likewise hiding something huge.</p>
<p>Some of the secrets come out and others are buried even deeper by the end, but as we know from the first pages, someone does take a fall, quite literally plunging from the top of the tower. Suicide? Murder? Accident? Read to the end to find out, but there&#8217;s still more fallout to be had.</p>
<p>There are other books planned, I believe, and I&#8217;m looking forward to them immensely. I do hope that McGee gives a voice to Ming in particular, a side character who seems like a one-dimensional queen-bee wannabe whose gossip-mongering generally only makes people cry. I have faith that McGee could do right by her, hopefully doing even more to advance the complexities of wealth and race she writes about so thoughtfully.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Coventry. A town located somewhere between over there and around about here. A town full of people, places and stories. Depending on who you talk to New Coventry was built on everything from fertile farming land to an ancient burial ground and was founded by pious pilgrims or lizard-headed demons. Whatever the case, New Coventry has had its share of good times and bad and it sure has a lot of stories to go around.</p>
<p>The Living Campaign series aims to bring those stories, good and bad, to the fore. Each article will explore a new place, or a new person, or some new event that’s taken place in New Coventry. It may be something good, something not so good or just something that the good folks of New Coventry just don’t like talking about.</p>
<p>The setting is rules agnostic, so feel free to pick and choose whatever you like, but the general feel is 1920’s small town; don’t expect too many dragons (maybe). If you’re running short on inspiration, every so often the Living Campaign will talk about how to use its various bits and pieces.</p>
<p>So with that, welcome to New Coventry stranger.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41441" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/7bf7bd17f50081de79b5d1177a73035d.jpg" alt="7bf7bd17f50081de79b5d1177a73035d" width="2000" height="1566" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/7bf7bd17f50081de79b5d1177a73035d.jpg 2000w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/7bf7bd17f50081de79b5d1177a73035d-300x235.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/7bf7bd17f50081de79b5d1177a73035d-768x601.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/7bf7bd17f50081de79b5d1177a73035d-1200x940.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/7bf7bd17f50081de79b5d1177a73035d-298x233.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/7bf7bd17f50081de79b5d1177a73035d-620x485.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><strong><u>Mr. Mackerton’s Magical Menagerie</u></strong></p>
<p>Tucked away just off Main Street between Mrs. Cauldrey’s flower shop and one of the many general stores is Mr. Mackerton’s <em>Magical Menagerie</em>.</p>
<p>Something of an oddity in New Coventry that, in turn, specializes in oddities. Inside the cramped, over-crowded walls one may find a variety of colored crystals, feathered ornaments and old books. Most of the citizens of New Coventry regard all of this as nothing but trickery, fluff, and something to be avoided on a Sunday just after church. Mr. Mackerton disagrees.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Menagerie&#8221; was established some 8 years ago after one Mr. Mackerton made the journey to New Coventry from South London. After making the over 3,000 mile journey, Mr. Mackerton arrived in New Coventry, cases and cases of magical curiosities in tow. The citizens of New Coventry all whisper that Mr. Mackerton, on his first night in New Coventry, did not stay in the space above his newly acquired shop. No, Mr. Mackerton it is said, stayed the first night out to the south of New Coventry in the Coventry forest. What exactly the owner of New Coventry’s finest magic shop did out in the woods is a mystery and subject to incredible levels of town gossip; not that Mr. Mackerton pays it any mind.</p>
<p>Mr. Mackerton runs his menagerie with all the seriousness and aplomb that his wares deserve. The store is well and truly a place to purchase magical items. The front of the shop is full of baubles, charms, and trinkets designed to fulfill the low-magic needs of any citizen. Simple spells and tokens designed to ward off spirits of the lowest order and information in only the vaguest sense.</p>
<p>All of this is here however, to distract from Mr. Mackerton’s upstairs storage. Should a customer be searching for a way to protect their house against evil spirits, Mackerton is your man. Equally, if one should be in the search for a vial of Dagonian lizard-man blood, Mackerton is also your man. The upstairs of Mr. Mackerton’s <em>Magical Menagerie</em> is the subject of many of a spooky drunken tale around New Coventry, and quite rightly so. For whatever reason, however he’s done it, Mr. Mackerton is in possession of some of the rarest tomes and artifacts this side of the Atlantic. A literal treasure trove that no man would ever dare try and steal. While he may not explicitly advertise it, any customer willing to prove his salt could, maybe, gain access to the real magic in Mr. Mackerton&#8217;s Magical Menagerie.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve spent any amount of time on this website, you know that Sailor Moon is a big part of the fandom of GeeklyInc. We have <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/tag/sailor-moon/">a real play RPG podcast, a series of articles looking at magical girl shows which was inspired by it, write-ups of the new series episodes</a>&#8230; you get the idea. To top that all off, my wife is a huge Moonhead (I assume that&#8217;s what the fanbase calls itself). I have seen a few random episodes of the show throughout the years and have heard a lot about it from Brittany, but never taken the time to dig into it myself.</p>
<p>That changes now. I have started where it all began, the manga, and am going volume by volume to see what all the fuss is about. For the sake of these reviews, I&#8217;m going to assume you are like me and don&#8217;t know the entire series inside and out.</p>
<p>This volume contains the first six chapters of the story (called acts in the comics). It starts by introducing us to Usagi, an ordinary fourteen year old student. Immediately her main character flaws are laid out for comedic effect and we learn that she is perpetually late for school, gets bad grades, and is easily distracted by things like video games, cute boys, and a cat with a bandage on it&#8217;s head. Even knowing this, we are endeared to Usagi because we see that, while she has obvious flaws, she genuinely wants to do better. Plus she helped that cat, who was <em>probably</em> from space.</p>
<p>It turns out the cat <em>was</em> from space. Also it can talk. Luna (the cat) figures out that Usagi is one of the guardians she has been looking for. She teaches Usagi how to transform just in time to save her friend Naru from a monster parading around as Naru&#8217;s mom. It turns out some evil baddies are trying to steal human energy to revive their dead ruler. This seems to happen by tempting humans with free stuff that they are too dumb to find suspicious.</p>
<p>After her first victory, Usagi is told she needs to assemble her allies, find a mysterious princess and guard her at all costs. The good news is Luna also knows how to use a computer (unlike Usagi) and has a full dossier on their next team member. Throughout this volume, Usagi finds the first three of her new allies, Sailor&#8217;s Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter. She also has several run-ins with the mysterious dreamboat Tuxedo Mask, who couldn&#8217;t possibly be that same guy Mamoru that she keeps running into. No way.</p>

<p>More battles are fought, more magical accessories are gained, and finally Usagi learns it is her job to find the &#8220;Legendary Silver Crystal&#8221; and unite her allies in victory against the gathering evil of Queen Beryl. Character development and plot points unfold quickly, likely due to how these stories were first serialized. Chapters fit a lot in without slowing down and there is plenty of content packed into each act.</p>
<p>Because of this, the pacing of each act sometimes feels rushed. There were a few times when I had to re-read panels to make sure I was clear on what had just happened. It wasn&#8217;t often enough that it made the book unenjoyable, but I could see a younger reader possibly getting hung up on those spots. I&#8217;m also unclear as to why Sailor Moon&#8217;s original costume has a cool mask that seems to exist solely so that she can immediately remove it. The mask looked dope.</p>
<div id="attachment_41575" style="width: 573px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-41575" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sailor-moon-cool-mask-min.jpg" alt="Sailor Moon with Cool Mask" width="563" height="557" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sailor-moon-cool-mask-min.jpg 563w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sailor-moon-cool-mask-min-300x297.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sailor-moon-cool-mask-min-75x75.jpg 75w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sailor-moon-cool-mask-min-298x295.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">What all this is is a sweet mask.</p></div>
<p>Overall I found Sailor Moon Volume 1 highly enjoyable. It has some funny character moments and even with it&#8217;s quick pace I found myself invested in the characters right from the start. I look forward to continuing my journey into manga history with volume 2.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A quiet, but still enjoyable couple of weeks on the comics front with an interesting issue of <em>Moon Knight</em> hitting the stands, the latest Young Animal series coming out and the new <em>Batman </em>arc kicking off. On top of that some of the usuals are back, with <em>Aquaman </em>having a brand-new issue. First up though, a look at an interesting issue of <em>Wonder Woman</em>.</p>

<h2><strong><em><u>Wonder Woman #8</u></em></strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_41527" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-41527" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ww-cover-780x1200.jpeg" alt="Wonder Woman #8- DC Comics" width="620" height="954" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ww-cover-780x1200.jpeg 780w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ww-cover-195x300.jpeg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ww-cover-768x1181.jpeg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ww-cover-298x458.jpeg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ww-cover-620x954.jpeg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wonder Woman #8- DC Comics</p></div>
<h3>Greg Rucka<br />
Bilquis Evely</h3>
<p>Another month, another excellent issue of <em>Wonder Woman.</em> When will I ever get bored? I kid of course, we all love <em>Wonder Woman</em>. But this month’s issue is really something special, or if not, at least it’s something a bit different. We get to take a break this week from <em>The Lies </em>and <em>Year One</em> and instead get <em>Interlude</em>. Essentially, Barbara Ann Minerva, the origin story. And it’s a real Indiana Jones type tale of discovery and adventure. There’s a real sense of character instilled in Dr. Minerva from the first few pages. Child Dr. Minerva has a belief in the mythological, a thirst for adventure, and an instantly sympathetic innocence about her. When returns as an adult in just afterwards, she’s much the same, if a little more articulate. She’s headstrong, curious, brave and is honestly the kind of interesting female character I would happily read in a solo series.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-41533" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ww-hlit-resize-1200x1023.jpg" alt="ww-hlit-resize" width="620" height="529" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ww-hlit-resize-1200x1023.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ww-hlit-resize-300x256.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ww-hlit-resize-768x655.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ww-hlit-resize-298x254.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ww-hlit-resize-620x529.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>The actual content of the issue is also up to the same scratch, if perhaps a little abrupt in its ending. After a failed archaeological dig and the traditional sneers from disbelieving colleagues, Dr Minerva sets off on a slight bender, a revelation and a globe-trotting journey; complete with map montage. The only real weakness comes in the last few pages where, after some puzzle piecing, Dr Minerva finds what she’s looking for and the issue ends. It feels sudden and just a little rushed, like there should be at least another few pages, if not another whole issue. But, with some top quality art from Bilquis Evely and a supremely cool main character, this is yet another rock-solid issue in the <em>Wonder Woman</em> line.</p>
<h2><strong><em><u>Cave Carson Has A Cybernetic Eye #1</u></em></strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_41531" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-41531 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cave-carson.jpg" alt="Cave Carson Has A Cybernetic Eye- DC's Young Animal" width="650" height="1000" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cave-carson.jpg 650w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cave-carson-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cave-carson-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cave-carson-620x954.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cave Carson Has A Cybernetic Eye- DC&#8217;s Young Animal</p></div>
<h3>Gerard Way &amp; Jon Rivera<br />
Michael Avon Oeming</h3>
<p>DC’s Young Animal has, thus far, been a rather odd (emphasis on odd) and mixed bag. <em>Shade The changing Girl</em> is a psychedelic sci-fi trip while <em>Doom Patrol </em>is basically a visual fever dream that defies explanation. <em>Cave Carson Has A Cybernetic Eye</em> is potentially the best, and most coherent, of the lot. Near as I can tell, our titular character’s wife has recently died. Now depressed and dealing with an estranged daughter, Cave Carson comes under just that little bit more pressure when his (you guessed it) cybernetic eye starts playing up. The eye shows him things that aren’t there, reveals things he’d rather not be revealed and generally messes with his head in a big way. The story is a kind of sci-fi mind trip, much like <em>Shade</em>, but with a certain pulpy action vibe to it that evens the whole thing out. Underground races, bug-people and a car that goes underground, it reeks of cheesy sci-fi comics in the best way. That, combined with a slightly broken hero gives the comic a fresh feeling.</p>
<p>Special mention has to also go to Michael Avon Oeming’s artwork which is nothing short of spectacular. It’s a highly stylized spectacle that oozes character. There’s a kind of Saturday morning cartoon vibe to it, crossed with this almost fantastical-tales/sci-fi anthology feel. Adding on top some of the most interesting layouts to come out in a while, <em>Cave Carson </em>is certainly one of the odder, but more fun comics I’ve picked up in a while.</p>
<h2><strong><em><u>Moon Knight #7</u></em></strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_41532" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-41532" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/moon-knit-cover-781x1200.jpg" alt="Moon Knight #7- Marvel" width="620" height="953" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/moon-knit-cover-781x1200.jpg 781w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/moon-knit-cover-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/moon-knit-cover-768x1180.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/moon-knit-cover-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/moon-knit-cover-620x953.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/moon-knit-cover.jpg 1041w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Moon Knight #7- Marvel</p></div>
<h3>Jeff Lemire<br />
Francesco Francavilla &amp; James Stoke</h3>
<p>Keeping with the weird theme here, <em>Moon Knight #7 </em>also hit the shelves recently. The previous issue ended on something of a head scratcher with Marc Spector now Moon Knight One now defending the moon. From werewolves. In spaceships. Thankfully we continue with that delightful weirdness this month and join a space-suited Marc Spector as he battles the wolves on the moon. Adding to his troubles is his minds tendency to shift him back to a watercolor and pastel-splashed New York, inhabiting the body of cabbie Jack Lockley.</p>
<p>The story, really, doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. But then <em>Moon Knight </em>as a whole has never made much sense. The story bounces, in some cases between panels, back and foth between the moon and New York. Between a high detail 90’s style and a soft, neon soaked New York. Jeff Lemire balances the two really well and despite beginning the issue brushing off the moon as a fantasy, he constructs the issue in a way that by the time you reach the end, there’s a bit of genuine doubt. It’s wacky, it’s weird, it’s beautiful and leaves you wanting more; <em>Moon Knight </em>this month is a definite highlight.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41536" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions-1.jpg" alt="honourable-mentions" width="3508" height="2480" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions-1.jpg 3508w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions-1-300x212.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions-1-768x543.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions-1-1200x848.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions-1-298x211.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions-1-620x438.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 3508px) 100vw, 3508px" /></p>
<p>Also hitting the stands this week is the first part of Tom King’s new <em>Batman </em>arc, <em>I Am Suicide</em>. Bizzaro name aside, it’s looking to be a pretty good arc with Batman making his way to South America to take on Bane in his home turf. I’ve always enjoyed Batman being Batman; sleuthing, slinking and generally not getting caught up in the saving the world. Fun lark that it is no doubt. This month Batman makes his preparations and hits up Arkham Asylum to gather his team. There is unfortunately just not enough flow to the whole issue compared to previous ones. It feels like we’re just being presented with Batman’s team in a pre-determined order with no other story to follow it. It’s still entertaining, and I look forward to the rest of the arc and the dynamic between the team. Not to mention the introduction of Bane in the first few pages is truly excellent and exactly the kind of understated thing I’ve come to expect from King, just maybe a little more story next week.</p>
<p>The second issue of <em>Doom Patrol </em>from Young Animal also came out recently and speaking of weird, this is it. I can understand <em>Shade </em>and <em>Cave Carson</em>, not so with <em>Doom Patrol</em>. What’s real? What’s not? Who cares? It’s a visual feast of imagery, odd constructs, and a story that doesn’t so much bounce around but spiral around in a direction that only it seems to know. I have very, very little idea as to what’s happening or who any of these characters are. But I do love me some interdimensional travel, evil robots and fever dreams, so hey, let’s just keep going then.</p>
<p>And finally <em>Aquaman #9 </em>hit the stands recently. The final part of the <em>Unstoppable </em>story line features this month as Aquaman faces of against the Shaggy Man in his home town of Amnesty Bay. Really there’s just not enough to this issue to justify it being one of the best this month. An enjoyable issue, to be sure, but mostly just a superhero punch up.</p>

<p class="p1">We are pleased to announce that GeeklyCon 2017 will take place in St. Louis, MO! We will be at The Crowne Plaza from July 20 &#8211; July 23.</p>
<p class="p1">Tickets are on sale at <a href="http://www.geeklycon.com"><span class="s1">http://www.geeklycon.com</span></a> &#8211; Standard Tickets are $50 and Premium Tickets are $100.</p>
<p class="p1">We have always had a GeeklyCon kickoff party, but we’ve grown a bit too large to go to a bar, so this year we are throwing a catered kickoff party at the hotel. While we don’t have the details nailed down, we will be providing appetizers and drink tickets (subject to change). To cover these costs, we are selling tickets to the party for $20. You will be able to buy additional drinks if you like. The party is 21+.</p>
<p class="p1">For those not familiar with GeeklyCon, here are some highlights:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">GeeklyCon will start at noon on Thursday.</li>
<li class="li1">There is a gaming room with a ton of board games to borrow. The room will open at noon on Thursday.</li>
<li class="li1">Besides board games, there will be plenty of opportunities to run or play in tabletop RPGs</li>
<li class="li1">Friday night we will have a live performance of Geekly podcasts at a local theatre (subject to change)</li>
<li class="li1">Sunday the gaming room will close at 6 PM, and we will have our traditional closing picnic with melee and award ceremony</li>
<li class="li1">There will be panels throughout the weekend on all sorts of topics</li>
<li class="li1">Outings to fun spots in St. Louis will be planned throughout the weekend as well!</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Rooms at The Crowne Plaza are available for a discounted rate of $139 a night, and suites are $199. We encourage you to reserve a room as soon as possible as space is limited. Call <b>877-272-6422</b>, and ask for group code <b>GEK</b>, or <a href="https://www.crowneplaza.com/redirect?path=hd&amp;brandCode=cp&amp;localeCode=en&amp;regionCode=1&amp;hotelCode=STLRF&amp;_PMID=99801505&amp;GPC=GEK&amp;viewfullsite=true"><span class="s1">input this for the group rate online</span></a>. <b>If you are coming before 7/19 or staying after 7/24 you may have to call to get the rate applied to your whole stay.</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Geeklies! Your resident “horrorphiles”, Meagan Varney and myself, have put ourselves to the test to provide you with enough spooky films to get your through this Halloween season. Each week we will release a new article with 7 horrifyingly haunting movies to keep you awake and wondering what really is making that creaking noise down the hallway. The majority of these movies will be available on streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu. Also, we are going to try and steer clear of the ones that always make horror movie lists. Of course we all love <em>Halloween</em>, <em>The Shining,</em> or <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, but we want to provide you with horror movies that you may not have watched yet to provide you with the best scares possible.  So grab your popcorn, turn off all the lights, and get ready to scare your pants off.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Creep (2014)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-41498" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/netflixcreep.jpg" alt="netflixcreep" width="1031" height="621" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/netflixcreep.jpg 500w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/netflixcreep-300x181.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/netflixcreep-298x179.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 1031px) 100vw, 1031px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starring and written by Patrick Brice and Mark Duplass (a personal favorite), this movie focuses on a freelance cameraman (Brice) who answers a Craigslist ad to be the personal videographer for a lonely man in the mountains (Duplass). This movie will remind you to listen to your mother when she said that you should NEVER ever trust anyone from Craigslist (sorry, folks, but as Karen and Georgia from <em>My Favorite Murder</em> Podcast would say, “Stay sexy”&#8230;).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Holidays (2016)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-41499" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20330ae033a999414c576ce576a83484.jpg" alt="20330ae033a999414c576ce576a83484" width="1013" height="1520" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20330ae033a999414c576ce576a83484.jpg 440w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20330ae033a999414c576ce576a83484-200x300.jpg 200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20330ae033a999414c576ce576a83484-298x447.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 1013px) 100vw, 1013px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I LOVE a good horror anthology, and was pleasantly surprised with “Holidays”. On Netflix, it looks unassuming and innocuous, but wow does it ever pack a surprising punch. There are 8 short stories &#8211; Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Easter, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Halloween, Christmas, and New Year’s Eve &#8211; all handled by a variety of talented directors including Nicholas McCarthy from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pact </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Dennis Widmyer and Kevin Kolsch from</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Starry Eyes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Each segment is short enough that it doesn’t drag but long enough to build a story. I was entertained from beginning to end, so go watch!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VHS 2 (2013)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-41500" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/V-H-S-2_Poster.jpg" alt="v-h-s-2_poster" width="1037" height="1537" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/V-H-S-2_Poster.jpg 400w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/V-H-S-2_Poster-202x300.jpg 202w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/V-H-S-2_Poster-298x442.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 1037px) 100vw, 1037px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know, I know, <em>VHS</em> is already on here. But why mess with success? <em>VHS 2</em> is another anthology that just nails it. This sequel continues what was so great about the original &#8211; clever, fresh stories, talented directors, fresh concept. All the stories in this sequel are great, but for me the best one far and away is “Safe Haven”, the segment shot as a documentary about a group who infiltrates an Indonesian cult. Great stuff and a must watch!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Guest (2014)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-41501" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cd37db4c-0e94-4a23-9c6a-404f64895f26.jpg" alt="cd37db4c-0e94-4a23-9c6a-404f64895f26" width="1021" height="1427" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cd37db4c-0e94-4a23-9c6a-404f64895f26.jpg 357w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cd37db4c-0e94-4a23-9c6a-404f64895f26-215x300.jpg 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cd37db4c-0e94-4a23-9c6a-404f64895f26-298x417.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 1021px) 100vw, 1021px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmed by Adam Wingard (personal favorite of Meagan’s), this movie features Dan Stevens as David, a young man who comes to visit the Petersons &#8211; the family of a fellow soldier who was killed in action. David eventually ingratiates himself with every member of the Peterson family and becomes a valuable and helpful house guest. The only one who he can&#8217;t manage to charm is the daughter, Anna (Maika Monroe), who is decidedly less impressed. I won&#8217;t say any more about what happens as it would be spoilers abound but the movie is fun, cool, mysterious, and quirky. Much more of an action film than I was expecting but even more entertaining for that. And to add to the fun is the multitude of cameos from some of the best: Lance Reddick (<em>The Wire</em>), Leland Orser (<em>Faults</em>), AJ Bowen (<em>A Horrible Way to Die</em>), Ethan Embry (<em>Can&#8217;t Hardly Wait</em>, every other awesome thing), Joel David Moore (<em>Dodgeball</em>), and Chris Ellis (<em>Armageddon</em>). Go see it, if for no other reason than seeing Dan Stevens shirtless. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A Horrible Way to Die (2010)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-41502" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a-horrible-way-to-die-poster.jpg" alt="a-horrible-way-to-die-poster" width="1007" height="1415" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a-horrible-way-to-die-poster.jpg 400w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a-horrible-way-to-die-poster-214x300.jpg 214w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a-horrible-way-to-die-poster-298x419.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 1007px) 100vw, 1007px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another one directed by Adam Wingard! <em>A Horrible Way to Die</em> tells the story of a convicted murderer (AJ Bowen) who escapes prison to find his former girlfriend (Amy Seimetz) who had moved to a small town to start over. The method of shooting with minimal lighting gives it a nice, darker feel that is necessary to set the tone for the plot. Seimetz does quiet desperation so well, especially in contrast to the robotic villain played by Bowen. Simple story, but handled with care, this is solid horror.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Starry Eyes (2014)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-41503" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Starry-Eyes.jpg" alt="starry-eyes" width="984" height="1458" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Starry-Eyes.jpg 409w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Starry-Eyes-202x300.jpg 202w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Starry-Eyes-298x442.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would you do for fame? That&#8217;s the question posed in <em>Starry Eyes</em>. Sarah is a young actress living in L.A. and working towards her Hollywood dream. As happens to many other ingenues, she is not having the success she would like. As her desperation and hunger for fame grows, she turns to a mysterious but intriguing group for help, inevitably getting what she wants, but with a steep price. While this movie has a fairly predictable plot, it is also shot beautifully and Alexandra Esso, who plays Sarah, is truly great. Definitely check it out if you are as enraptured as we are with the dark side of Hollywood! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Strangers (2008)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-41504" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/strangers_ver4.jpg" alt="strangers_ver4" width="983" height="1453" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/strangers_ver4.jpg 410w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/strangers_ver4-203x300.jpg 203w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/strangers_ver4-298x440.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This movie has a fairly straightforward plot &#8211; a couple, recently at a crossroads in their relationship, goes to the man’s family cabin in the woods to figure everything out. As the night goes on, they realize they are being hunted, but they don’t know why. Rumored to be based on the Manson family murders, this movie will make you feel so deeply uncomfortable because it could so easily happen. There could be a thousand of these stalkers all over the country, and happenstance could bring them to your doorstep. Once it is over, this movie will leave you paranoid, but thoroughly entertained. A great one for “confronting your fears”!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Arkham Horro</span></em><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">r</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> line of games from Fantasy Flight is constantly growing. The latest game to join the line is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arkham Horror: The Card Game</span></em><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a living card game. A living card game means that all the expansions and packs released are standardized. With an expansion and new scenario pack already announced, Fantasy Flight seems ready to support this new game with a several releases of new material. Before we jump too far ahead though, let’s take a look at the core set releasing this month. </span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-41470 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0404.jpg" alt="rsz_img_0404" width="336" height="437" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0404.jpg 1728w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0404-231x300.jpg 231w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0404-768x999.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0404-922x1200.jpg 922w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0404-298x388.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0404-620x807.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arkham Horror: The Card Game </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">is intended to be played over a campaign that weaves different scenarios into a cohesive story. Each player controls an investigator that is plunged into a world of strange beings and mind bending visions. The core set contains the campaign “Night of the Zealot” which starts innocently enough, when the door to your study suddenly vanishes. This simple start to the game leads players across three scenarios each with their own objectives, until the resolution. Multiple resolution to each scenario are possible so don&#8217;t take your decisions lightly. The cards in your deck will represent different skills, assets, or events that can help you solve the mysteries gripping your town. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the game, play is broken down into four different phases that repeat until the conclusion of the game. Players begin in the “Mythos Phase” (although it is skipped in the first turn) with a doom token being placed on the current agenda and each player drawing an encounter card. So far the encounter cards I have played have all been hindrances for investigators. For example, dissonant voices could creep into your mind and limit the actions available this turn. Testing one of the investigators&#8217; skills may be required to resist the effects of these cards. </span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-41471 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0413.jpg" alt="rsz_img_0413" width="407" height="272" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0413.jpg 2592w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0413-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0413-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0413-1200x800.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0413-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0413-620x413.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an encounter calls for a test it will give you threshold to pass, you will compare the investigator&#8217;s skill level to that value. Players can contribute cards containing the symbol of the test and add to the investigators value. Given that this is an <em>Arkham Horror</em> game there always has to be a higher chance of failure than success. The player testing a skill will have to pull from a bag to reveal a token that either contains a value modifier or a token with a symbol. Symbols can range from outright failure, no matter what players value is at, to unhinging an investigator&#8217;s hidden power. Distribution of the tokens in the bag is dependent on the scenario as well as the difficulty players decide on at the beginning.</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-41469 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0402.jpg" alt="rsz_img_0402" width="481" height="320" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0402.jpg 2592w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0402-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0402-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0402-1200x800.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0402-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rsz_img_0402-620x413.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is the “Investigator Phase” where players can take three actions. Player actions range from testing skills, drawing cards, attacking/evade creatures, gathering resources (which act as a currency in this game), activating previously played cards, and moving. While this is a card game and does not include a board or miniatures, movement is a large component to game play. If there are enemies in play they take their actions after the players. Mostly they will be attacking characters or moving into areas with investigators, in order to attack on their next turn. Once all the enemies have had their turn, the “Upkeep Phase” is last. This is where most of the house keeping is done, when exhausted cards are readied, players gain one resource, and draw a card. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five investigators come in this core set, however you won’t be able to play with the suggested builds with all of them. All characters have a main class and a sub class from which they can access cards. For example, Roland Banks is the main class Enforcer and subclass Seeker. To build his suggested deck you need to use all the Enforcer class cards and all the Seeker class cards. This would prevent you from building the suggested decks for Daisy Walker (Seeker main class), or Skids O’Toole (Enforcer subclass), due to all you cards being used in the Roland Banks. Role playing as your investigator is very encouraged. Choices need to be made in the campaign and the immersive text wraps you into this world, making the barrier to roleplaying lower. You can leverage the deck building aspect to develop a backstory for your character. Players can also think about how their investigators interact with each other; would the ex-con be attracted to the waitress with a mystical look in her eye, or perhaps the strong willed street urchin that has a mysterious and valuable necklace.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the aspects </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arkham Horror: The Card Game </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">boasts is the customization of decks. While that is true the game does not force you to use the suggested decks and players are encouraged to custom build decks, the game just seems less accessible this way. I would prefer to be able to play the character I like without having to explore the intricacies of deck building. With future expansions this aspect could go away as more characters or class cards become available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am very impressed with the presentation of <em>Arkham Horror: The Card Game </em>with artwork that pops and accompanies a fantastic story full of intrigue. The text on the card is also very clear and legible, which can be overlooked in card games. If there is a question over something specific, Fantasy Flight’s reference guide comes in handy, answering many questions that can come up during play. A downside I encountered to this game is that unless you are willing to purchase two copies. Lacking the ability to play any combination of investigators you want is a discouragement for me. In addition, one copy only allows you to play with one to two players where two copies allows for play with up to four. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However if you are willing to look past purchasing two copies, a rich and engaging story with some replayability lies in wait for you. </span></p>

<p>Things are starting to get interesting here in the park. Ford is flexing his muscles and begins to show us whats really going on and who&#8217;s really in charge.</p>
<p>This was probably the strongest episode since the premier and things are moving fast. The man in black is speed running his quest for the maze, we find out that Dolores is also on that hunt. William and Logan also decide to go black hat. Back at the friendly brothel, things are going haywire.</p>
<p>All I can say, is we cannot wait for more!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Geeklies! Your resident &#8220;horrorphiles&#8221;, Meagan Varney and myself, have put ourselves to the test to provide you with enough spooky films to get your through this Halloween season. Each week we will release a new article with 7 horrifyingly haunting movies to keep you awake and wondering what really is making that creaking noise down the hallway. The majority of these movies will be available on streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu. Also, we are going to try and steer clear of the ones that always make horror movie lists. Of course we all love <em>Halloween</em>, <em>The Shining,</em> or <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, but we want to provide you with horror movies that you may not have watched yet to provide you with the best scares possible. This week we are bringing you some of our favorite and maybe lesser known foreign horror films. So grab your popcorn, turn off all the lights, and get ready to scare your pants off.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[REC] (2007)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41426" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Rec_poster.jpg" alt="rec_poster" width="730" height="1027" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Rec_poster.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Rec_poster-213x300.jpg 213w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Rec_poster-298x419.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Spanish horror film that is sure to make you run for the hills and ready your survival kits,</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [Rec]</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> follows Angela, a television reporter, who is sent out to go on a night watch with the local fire department. During the night, there is a call out to an elderly woman’s apartment and the elderly woman who has found herself trapped. While on the call, screaming is heard and everyone quickly realizes that the elderly woman isn’t just trapped but has been attacked. Rushing to the scene, Angela and the fire department find an apartment building that has been thrown into chaos and soon discover that sometimes staying inside is the most dangerous place to hide.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>6 Films to Keep You Awake (2006)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41427" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/27_6films.png" alt="27_6films" width="753" height="1033" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/27_6films.png 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/27_6films-219x300.png 219w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/27_6films-298x409.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Spanish film makes the list as this anthology of short stories comes together to make one terrifying tale. Each story focuses on a different story, ranging from the dangers of moving into a new apartment or the sinister figure lurking in the dark corners of a room, and several more stories that will make you gasp in horror. Each tale is short and to the point, so in the event you can’t stand a whole feature film, this is a great pick for getting your horror fix in bite sized chunks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Let Us Prey (2014)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41428" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/let_us_prey.jpg" alt="let_us_prey" width="747" height="1058" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/let_us_prey.jpg 533w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/let_us_prey-212x300.jpg 212w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/let_us_prey-298x422.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Heggie is a cop located at a new precinct and put into the least desirable night shift in a neglected Scottish police station. Surrounded by the misfits and crooked cops, who have been moved to the station and all but forgotten, Rachel is trying to make the best of the situation. When a few citizens are brought in on different charges, strange things start happening around the station. As the night progresses, there is less of a will to protect and serve the public and everyone finds themselves protecting their own lives. Bonus, for any </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fans, the actor who plays Davos is one of the characters!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Canal (2014)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41429" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The_Canal_2014_Irish_horror_movie_poster.jpg" alt="the_canal_2014_irish_horror_movie_poster" width="723" height="1035" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The_Canal_2014_Irish_horror_movie_poster.jpg 348w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The_Canal_2014_Irish_horror_movie_poster-210x300.jpg 210w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The_Canal_2014_Irish_horror_movie_poster-298x426.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David is a man who has been stretched to his limits. Work is stressful, his wife might be cheating on him, and, then on top of it all, he is given footage from his boss that shows his home being the site of brutal murders in 1902. After viewing the film,, David begins to believe he can sense and see the presence of these murdered spirits still lingering in the home, exacting their revenge. As David becomes more disturbed he is confronted with finding out that his wife has been cheating on him with a work client. Shortly after David’s wife, Alice, is missing and going to the police, David finds himself as suspect number one. But can David prove Alice isn’t missing because of him or has reality shifted so much that David doesn’t know what is real and what is supernatural?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Pontypool (2008)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41430" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pontypool.jpg" alt="pontypool" width="958" height="1418" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pontypool.jpg 510w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pontypool-203x300.jpg 203w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pontypool-298x441.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grant and Sydney work together in a small town’s radio station in Ontario, Canada, which, under normal circumstances, is just a sleepy little town. As Grant comes into work and settles into his talk show, strange things start happening around the town as well as the station. What appears to be a quick moving and devastating virus strikes the town and soon a mass of sick and violent townspeople start attacking the station. In this psychological horror film, it is up to Grant and Sydney to try and figure out how to stop the virus and make it out of Pontypool alive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>American Mary (2012)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41431" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/american_mary_ver2.jpg" alt="american_mary_ver2" width="838" height="1196" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/american_mary_ver2.jpg 529w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/american_mary_ver2-210x300.jpg 210w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/american_mary_ver2-298x425.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another great horror flick from our neighbors to the North, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Mary</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tells of Mary Mason, a medical student who is struggling to pay her way through college. Taking a job opportunity that starts as being disguised as an exotic dancer, Mary finds herself wrapped up in the world of underground cosmetic surgery. Gaining big bucks and patients waiting in line to have Mary work on them, Mary quickly becomes popular in this subversive world but also learns of the dangers that lurk in the corners of this society.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Mama (2013)</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41434" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MPW-77642.jpg" alt="mpw-77642" width="800" height="1187" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MPW-77642.jpg 500w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MPW-77642-202x300.jpg 202w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MPW-77642-298x442.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada keeps putting out these amazing horror flicks and one that won’t escape this list is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mama</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When the big stock market crashes in the mid 80s, some of the wealthy lose the majority of their money. One family, when faced with this reality have a tragic ending. Abandoned in the wild after the death of their parents, Victoria and Lilly grow up knowing no other family than “Mama”. When they are found 5 years later and sent to live with their uncle, the family finds out that Mama may not be an imaginary friend so much as a dark intervening force that is threatening to rip the family apart.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Coventry. A town located somewhere between over there and around about here. A town full of people, places and stories. Depending on who you talk to New Coventry was built on everything from fertile farming land to an ancient burial ground and was founded by pious pilgrims or lizard-headed demons. Whatever the case, New Coventry has had its share of good times and bad and it sure has a lot of stories to go around.</p>
<p>The Living Campaign series aims to bring those stories, good and bad, to the forefront. Each article will explore a new place, or a new person, or some new event that’s taken place in New Coventry. It may be something good, something not so good or just something that the good folks of New Coventry just don’t like talking about.</p>
<p>The setting is rules agnostic, so feel free to pick and choose whatever you like, but the general feel is 1920’s small town; don’t expect too many dragons (maybe). If you’re running short on inspiration, every so often the Living Campaign will talk about how to use its various bits and pieces.</p>
<p>So with that, welcome to New Coventry stranger.</p>

<h2><u>McGregor&#8217;s Boat Shed</u></h2>
<p>The northern end of Lake Coventry is pleasant. Sunny, idyllic (sometimes), and full laughing children in the summer. A place for good times and fun. On the southern end, well, it’s less so. There’s also McGregor&#8217;s Boat Shed; considered by some to be one of the more persistent stains on Coventry’s history.</p>
<h4><em>Transcript of a story told by James Pateman, local coot:</em></h4>
<p>&#8220;Around 40 years ago, or so it goes, ol&#8217; Patrick McGregor builds his boat shed on the south end of Lake Coventry. McGregor was told not to; the south end of Lake Coventry has never been friendly towards people all that much y’see? But he goes and does it anyways, and for a while he uses it every day. Zipping out there, much as he could zip, on that lake with his wife and little girl. And that boat shed was there, keeping his boat all dry and whatnot. But see here’s the thing… You’re still writing? Cause this is the thing y’see? He ain&#8217;t never locked that boat up once. Well, that’s how it goes, I’s just a boy at the time y’see?</p>
<p>But they said, McGregor ain&#8217;t never need to lock that boat up. Cause he and that shed, the dang ground it was on, they’s had a deal. Look after my boat, I’ll give you something in return they’s said. McGregor took them critters round his house, round his shed, and cut ‘im. Cut ‘im and bleed ‘im on that ground. Said a whole pile of nasty things while he did it too. Why he did all that for a boat I dunno. Gold? Jewels? Didn’t want nobody in that damn shed.</p>
<p>&#8216;Cept one day, ol’ McGregor gets to thinking about all them critters, and all them nasty words and he takes his wife and his little girl, and he cuts ‘im too. And then he cut ‘imself. Ain&#8217;t no one built another shed that end o&#8217; the lake since, wouldn’t do it if ya paid me. Course McGregor is still in there y’see? Waiting to grab somebody, and cut ‘im. Or, that’s how it goes.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Geeklies! Your resident &#8220;horrorphiles&#8221;, Meagan Varney and myself, have put ourselves to the test to provide you with enough spooky films to get your through this Halloween season. Each week we will release a new article with 7 horrifyingly haunting movies to keep you awake and wondering what really is making that creaking noise down the hallway. The majority of these movies will be available on streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu. Also, we are going to try and steer clear of the ones that always make horror movie lists. Of course we all love <em>Halloween</em>, <em>The Shining,</em> or <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, but we want to provide you with horror movies that you may not have watched yet to provide you with the best scares possible. So grab your popcorn, turn off all the lights, and get ready to scare your pants off.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Invitation (2015)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41330" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/invitation_ver2.jpg" alt="invitation_ver2" width="741" height="921" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/invitation_ver2.jpg 519w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/invitation_ver2-241x300.jpg 241w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/invitation_ver2-298x370.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens when your ex-wife invites you and your new girlfriend over for a dinner party with friends? That is the base premise for the movie that centers around Will and his new girlfriend as they attend the dinner party of his ex-wife who disappeared for 2 years after the death of their child and resurfaced with a new husband and a new eerily positive personality. Will is reminded of his previous life and believes sinister things are afoot, but can we, the viewers, really trust Will and his perspective of reality? A seriously thrilling and horrific movie that will keep you guessing till the end. Get your charcuterie boards and wine ready and invite your friends over to kick off the Halloween season!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Intruders (2015)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41331" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/51MgkpjLe8L.jpg" alt="51mgkpjle8l" width="740" height="1045" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/51MgkpjLe8L.jpg 354w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/51MgkpjLe8L-212x300.jpg 212w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/51MgkpjLe8L-298x421.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna lives in a big old house with an ailing family member, until one day when Anna’s relative passes away from sickness. With the death of her family, Anna becomes a recluse and agoraphobic, staying inside and away from everyone. News somehow gets around that she is living alone with a nice sized inheritance and one day, three men come to try and take Anna’s fortune. The only thing they don’t know is that Anna isn’t as innocent as she seems. This movie takes a classic “home intruder” situation and puts a wonderfully horrific  twist on the story.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VHS (2012)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41332" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vhs.jpg" alt="vhs" width="723" height="1072" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vhs.jpg 509w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vhs-202x300.jpg 202w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vhs-298x442.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This “found footage” style movie is one that is more likely to make you pee your pants than get motion sick. A group of intruders is hired by a mysterious third party to carry out and film different crimes, when they come across some videos and decide to watch them in one of houses of their victims. Instead of the fun family videos they are expecting, they find several videos depicting gruesome murders, strange deaths, and unexplained events. The way in which this movie is filmed and compiled keeps the stories short and able to scare you fast before moving to the next terrifying tale, keeping you always on the edge of your seat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Last Shift (2014)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41333" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/last-shift-anthony-diblasi-movie-poster.jpg" alt="last-shift-anthony-diblasi-movie-poster" width="725" height="1075" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/last-shift-anthony-diblasi-movie-poster.jpg 460w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/last-shift-anthony-diblasi-movie-poster-202x300.jpg 202w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/last-shift-anthony-diblasi-movie-poster-298x442.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Loren is on her first night watch as a rookie cop and is tasked with assisting the pick up of bio-hazard waste. While on watch, Jessica finds out that the prison holds supernatural power ever since cult leader, John Michael Paymon, and two of his followers committed suicide. As the night progresses, the haunting get more and more severe, pulling Jessica closer to the realm of the dead than the living. Can Jessica make it through her first night watch? Or will she succumb to the cult of John Michael Paymon?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Taking of Deborah Logan (2014)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41334" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The_Taking_of_Deborah_Logan.png" alt="the_taking_of_deborah_logan" width="751" height="1115" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The_Taking_of_Deborah_Logan.png 373w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The_Taking_of_Deborah_Logan-202x300.png 202w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The_Taking_of_Deborah_Logan-298x443.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a family member battling Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, Sarah Logan allows a documentary crew to start filming her ailing mother to capture her condition. For a short while, things go well and the crew become close with the family, privy to their private lives. As the crew documents the struggles of being a caregiver and with Deborah slipping everyday further and further into her dementia, horrifying habit and situations start arising. Are these just the devastating side effects of Deborah’s sickness or is there more than what the mind can perceive going on in the home?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Visit (2015)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41335" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/visit.jpg" alt="visit" width="731" height="1159" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/visit.jpg 476w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/visit-189x300.jpg 189w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/visit-298x473.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a M. Night Shyamalan movie that does not disappoint on the twist. When Becca and Tyler are sent to their grandparents house for a week during summer, Becca takes her camera along to record her experiences in the hopes of reuniting her mother and grandparents. Instead what happens is that Becca and Tyler start discovering and uncovering some family secrets that were not meant to be known. Being a truly terrifying movie in some scenes, the theme and pace of the movie keep the viewer wondering if family secrets are better left secret.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Silent House (2011)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41336" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Silent-House.jpg" alt="silent-house" width="719" height="1079" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Silent-House.jpg 400w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Silent-House-200x300.jpg 200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Silent-House-298x447.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a remake of a South American horror film from the same name and is supposedly based off true events. Very few movies manage to scare me but while watching this, I literally sat at the edge of my couch, hands over my mouth, screeching out with every twist and scene. Elizabeth Olsen plays Sarah, a teenager who is traveling to her family’s lakeside home with her father to pick up some items as the house has recently been sold. While there, her uncle stops by, but shortly after supernatural things start happening around the house, terrorizing the family. Cut off from all forms of communication and no neighbors nearby, will Sarah and her family be able to make it out of the peaceful lakeside home alive or is there something sinister trying to keep them there forever? </span></p>

<p>Ok, I guess we should have guessed that Harper would have some sort of &#8230; something after entering Longcryer&#8217;s tower.

What internal battles fought long ago are being replayed as we helplessly watch? I guess we can stand over him and protect him and did he just mumble &#8220;Camille&#8221;?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Possibly one of the biggest fortnights in a while, thanks in no small part to <em>Batman</em>’s first big crossover <em>Night of the Monster Men </em>kicking off. Also rearing its misshapen head is another amazing issue of <em>Clean Room</em>, DC’s second Young Animal series <em>Shade the Changing Girl</em> and <em>The Autumnlands </em>finally makes a welcome return.</p>

<h2><strong><em><u>Clean Room #12</u></em></strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_41371" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-41371" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Clean-room-12-780x1200.jpg" alt="Clean Room #12- Vertigo" width="620" height="954" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Clean-room-12-780x1200.jpg 780w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Clean-room-12-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Clean-room-12-768x1182.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Clean-room-12-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Clean-room-12-620x954.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Clean-room-12.jpg 832w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Clean Room #12- Vertigo</p></div>
<h3>Gail Simone<br />
John Davis Hunt</h3>
<p>12 issues in and I’m constantly waiting for <em>Clean Room </em>to slow down and start disappointing me, like a high-achieving child that falls by the way-side. It’s more like the child who achieves their masters whilst saving orphans in other countries, constantly achieving, and somehow doing better than ever before. Last month we saw an Astrid Mueller that was on the ropes, barely clinging to her power, and a Spark that was poised to kill half our cast. It looked to be a terrible end to a great series. I should have had faith.</p>
<p>Speaking of faith, Chloe steps up as a genuine character with agency this month and activates the Clean Room, taking us back to Spark’s original exorcism. The entire sequence is, frankly, highly uncomfortable and features a fair amount of blood. It is also excellent and serves as a somewhat nauseating reminder of the evil nature that Astrid and Chloe face. It’s quite the contrast from the first few issues where Chloe was a bit of a back-seat player and the last few issues she’s really come to the fore and become a very cool character. With her connection to the Clean Room no doubt to be explored more, I am looking forward to where she goes next.</p>
<div id="attachment_41373" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-41373" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/clean-room-highlight-1-794x1200.jpg" alt="John-Davis Hunt's art is as amazing as ever" width="620" height="937" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/clean-room-highlight-1-794x1200.jpg 794w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/clean-room-highlight-1-199x300.jpg 199w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/clean-room-highlight-1-768x1160.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/clean-room-highlight-1-298x450.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/clean-room-highlight-1-620x937.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">John-Davis Hunt&#8217;s art is as amazing as ever</p></div>
<p>The real highlight however, is Astrid. I won’t spoil the exact nature of her comeback, but rest assured, it’s quality stuff. It’s the kind of cold, calculated and monologue heavy sort of execution I’ve come to expect from her. It’s particularly satisfying to be horrendously wrong in this instance. Mr. Wenuka is revealed to not be the next big threat at all, rather it’s the same monsters we’ve come to know and love. It’s a good twist, and fits perfectly within the universe of <em>Clean Room</em>. With one of the better, more well-meaning and more sinister characters I’ve read in a while making a triumphant return, now is a good time to be a <em>Clean Room </em>fan.</p>
<h2><strong><em><u>Shade the Changing Girl #1</u></em></strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_41374" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-41374" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shade-1-780x1200.jpg" alt="Shade: The Changing Girl #1- DC's Young animal" width="620" height="954" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shade-1-780x1200.jpg 780w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shade-1-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shade-1-768x1182.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shade-1-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shade-1-620x954.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shade-1.jpg 832w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Shade: The Changing Girl #1- DC&#8217;s Young animal</p></div>
<h3>Cecil Castellucci<br />
Marley Zarcone</h3>
<p>Let’s be 100% clear with each other. <em>Shade the Changing Girl</em> is very, very odd. All of DC’s Young Animal have been so far. Last month’s <em>Doom Patrol</em>, while enjoyable, did slip a little too far over into the weird territory. <em>Shade</em> has managed to delicately skirt that line and it has made for a great, if weird, comic. It all kicks off when the alien Loma Shade inhabits the body of a comatose girl, Megan.</p>
<p>There’s kind of a dual narrative running here, one where we discover who Loma is, and another where we discover who Megan is. Or rather, used to be prior to Loma’s arrival (she was in something of coma). <em>Shade</em> is a psychedelic trip through a truly odd sci-fi tale almost in the spirit of some of the stranger comics from the 70’s and 80’s. Those looking for a conventional story, conventional narrative, or even conventional art style will firmly want to stay away. <em>Shade </em>is not half-brain Sunday reading. <em>Shade </em>is the kind of comic that not only demands multiple readings, but actually requires it. It poses questions about the nature of sanity, perception and self; all while managing to squeeze out a pretty decent story. While it remains to be seen if it can stay consistent in the slightest, for now I’m quietly optimistic about <em>Shade the Changing Girl</em>.</p>
<h2><strong><em><u>Aquaman #7/8</u></em></strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_41376" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-41376" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aquaman-cover-780x1200.jpg" alt="Aquaman #7- DC Comics" width="620" height="954" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aquaman-cover-780x1200.jpg 780w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aquaman-cover-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aquaman-cover-768x1182.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aquaman-cover-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aquaman-cover-620x954.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aquaman-cover.jpg 832w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Aquaman #7- DC Comics</p></div>
<h3>Dan Abnett<br />
Scott Eaton</h3>
<p>I am a huge sucker for alternative worlds. I love stories about other societies, technologies, and systems. So it’s no wonder I’ve fallen for the latest couple <em>Aquaman </em>issues hook, line, and sinker. Eight issues of <em>Aquaman</em> and that is the first time I’ve made that joke. I’m proud of myself. Anyway, fishy sounding jokes aside (I’m sorry), these last couple issues of <em>Aquaman </em>are really quite excellent. After a tense throwdown with Superman in #6, we return to Atlantis, and a turbulent Atlantis at that.</p>
<p>I mentioned this when the series started, but it’s always great to see Arthur/Aquaman the king. Not the hero, not the man who punches things, but careful statesman. That’s on full display here and Dan Abnett is to be congratulated for writing a genuinely smart and thoughtful hero. While it would have been easy for Aquaman to have simply punched or bravadoed his way out of an interrogation of a Deluge terrorist, it was refreshing to see him genuinely reason with him and come to a peaceful conclusion.</p>
<p>The real stand out from the two issues is Atlantis itself. From the varied members of its high council to the newly revealed trials Mera must go through to wed Arthur, Abnett has created this rich and interesting backdrop for his story that serves to make it just that much better. With Aquaman all set to start fighting a war on multiple fronts and Mera dealing with mysterious Atlantean trials, I’m excited to see the next issue.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41390" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions.jpg" alt="honourable-mentions" width="3508" height="2480" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions.jpg 3508w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions-300x212.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions-768x543.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions-1200x848.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions-298x211.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honourable-Mentions-620x438.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 3508px) 100vw, 3508px" /></p>
<p>A small, but amazing, handful of other issues dropped this week. <em>Bounty #4</em> hit the stands and although it was a little slow in terms of story, it more than made up for it in terms of characterization, humor, and a great ending. <em>Bounty </em>must actually be congratulated for being, from the beginning, one of the most consistent comics around. Much like Weibe’s other series, <em>Rat Queens</em>, the real joy comes the character’s interactions, and that’s on full display here. There is a genuine pleasure to be gained from just being with the Gadflies. On top of that is the highly interesting story that’s playing the background and the refreshing sense of agency that our characters have. Maybe I’m just sheltered but I’m loving having a series filled with female characters that are not only capable of having interesting stories, but are capable of fixing their own problems. More please.</p>
<p>Speaking of incredible female characters, <em>Wonder Woman #7 </em>hit the stands recently with part 4 of <em>The Lies</em>. A strong, visually appealing issue with Liam Sharp’s art really standing out from his gorgeous rendition of Wonder Woman to the very creepy and cool Urzkartaga. Often in comics from one of the two big publishers there is a tendency to play it safe with panels and layouts, not so here with a variety of flows and borders, making for a pretty cool reading experience. The story, while entertaining, just doesn’t measure up to the art or what has come before. While it was predictable that Urzkataga would be defeated, the way he was defeated felt just a little forced and kind of like it came from nowhere. That said, the bar set by the previous 6 issues is pretty darn high, so there was bound to be a disappointment at some point.</p>
<p>We also finally received another issue of <em>The Autumnlands</em> with issue 13. Now, don’t mistake me here, <em>The Autumnlands</em> is still an amazing series that you simply have to be reading. And this issue is pretty damn good. It just doesn’t make a whole heap of sense. Occasionally in a longer series like <em>The Autumnlands</em>, there comes a few issues that are far more satisfying when read with other issues, rather than alone. This is one of them. While the series does of course raise questions at all times and keep you wondering, there’s just a little too much of that going on and just a few too many plot threads and hints to keep tied down in the old brain-box. Perhaps when paired with <em>The Autumnlands #14</em> a little more joy will be found. But for now, a slightly overstuffed chapter in an otherwise sleek and wonderful series.</p>
<p>Lastly DC Comics first large-ish cross-over event <em>Night of the Monster Men</em> is running rampant across <em>Batman</em>, <em>Detective Comics,</em> and <em>Nightwing</em>. The event isn’t much to write home about in terms of epic storytelling. That said, it’s still pretty bloody enjoyable and seeing the Bat-family fight giant, mutant monsters is quite fun. The cross-over format is also taken advantage of here with each issue actually used to tell a separate piece of story, allowing the whole thing to breathe. Too often a cross-over is used to tell a bigger, longer story, rather than just a more developed one. With one part to go, each issue having its own flavor, I am eagerly awaiting the final chapter.</p>

<p>Listeners, do you hear that? Is that flapping noise the sound of the New Jersey Devil? Oh wait, its just the sound of THOUSANDS of moths coming for Sarah!</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s episode, Michael, Sarah, and Bijaya discuss Aragog, Hagrid&#8217;s trusted and cuddly giant spider-friend, whilst questioning Hagrid&#8217;s logic in sending children to meet with his said (murderous) spider-friend. The Quizzich Cup rivalry is heating up (its Finch, not Flinch) and the gang talks about their phobias, past and present.</p>

<p>Three newer &#8220;Harper&#8221; models huh? If one wasn&#8217;t bad enough now there are three more ab-having sorcerers to deal with? Just great. Who knows what Longcryer has done to these people so we must be on our guard. Maybe they are not as bad as they look. They look like they want to hurt us very much and now we have to assume there must be some sort of brain washing going on. This place sucks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Geeklies! Your resident &#8220;horrorphiles&#8221;, Meagan Varney and I, have put ourselves to the test to provide you with enough spooky films to get your through this Halloween season. Each week, we will release a new article with 7 horrifyingly haunting movies to keep you awake and wondering what really is making that creaking noise down the hallway. The majority of these movies will be available on streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu. Also, we are going to try and steer clear of the ones that always make horror movie lists. Of course we all love <em>Halloween</em>, <em>The Shining,</em> or <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, but we want to provide you with horror movies that you may not have watched yet so you that will get the best scares possible. So grab your popcorn, turn off all the lights, and get ready to scare your pants off.</p>
<p><strong>Tucker and Dale vs. Evil (2010)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41318" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/photo_05-1.jpg" alt="photo_05" width="710" height="1002" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/photo_05-1.jpg 399w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/photo_05-1-213x300.jpg 213w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/photo_05-1-298x420.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horror-Comedy as a genre is a contradiction. “But &#8211; it’s gory and scary and gross, and also, I laughed? Am I a terrible person?” The answer &#8211; you’re not. You understand the seriousness of a situation but are also trying to cope with it with the only thing to lift anxiety at the worst of times &#8211; laughter. For me, this movie is the ultimate. It centers around Tucker and Dale, two friends who are having a nice vacation in their mountain cabin when they encounter a bunch of rowdy college students who truly defy stereotypes. Fun, silly, self-aware and smart, this film understands what it is and crushes it. I highly recommend this to kick off the Halloween season and ease you into the month of scares. It’s wonderful and fun &#8211; what more do you need?</span></p>
<p><strong>Darknet (2013)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41321" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Darknet.jpg" alt="darknet" width="1250" height="625" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Darknet.jpg 1250w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Darknet-300x150.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Darknet-768x384.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Darknet-1200x600.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Darknet-298x149.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Darknet-620x310.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this might somewhat be cheating on this list, but our next pick is a Canadian horror television show. The show is comprised of 6 episodes that have loosely intertwined stories and feature tales of the macabre and terrifying. A few different themes in the show are dangerous intruders, sinister family members, murderous strangers, and the dangers of what you can get into on the darkest reaches of the internet. With each episode around 30 minutes, this is definitely something that is binge-able on a dark and creepy October night.</span></p>
<p><strong>Scream: The Series (2015)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41315" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/8224baf00b84be3ec46e6f440819265d.jpg" alt="8224baf00b84be3ec46e6f440819265d" width="500" height="741" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/8224baf00b84be3ec46e6f440819265d.jpg 500w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/8224baf00b84be3ec46e6f440819265d-202x300.jpg 202w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/8224baf00b84be3ec46e6f440819265d-298x442.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another series but this one is a take on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anthology of movies. The series focuses on a group of high school students whose town has been rocked with the death of a classmate. After the death, mysterious things start happening around the town. As things start escalating, it is discovered that a killer from many years ago seems to have resurfaced and is taking their vengeance out on this group of friends. Who is the killer? Will they be caught? Who dies next? This show answers these questions in a highly formulaic and predictable way, but is an entertaining series that can be your new guilty pleasure horror series.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Zombeavers (2014)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41316" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/big-poster-beavers.jpg" alt="big-poster-beavers" width="779" height="1154" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/big-poster-beavers.jpg 395w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/big-poster-beavers-203x300.jpg 203w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/big-poster-beavers-298x441.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 779px) 100vw, 779px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens when you cross radioactive waste and beavers? ZOMBEAVERS!!! In this throwback to “B-style” horror flicks, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zombeavers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mixes comedy and horror into this wonderfully campy film. A group of female friends travel to a cabin to get away from their boyfriends (or ex-boyfriend, in one case) and just spend some time bonding. Well after the boyfriends sneak to the cabin, all hell starts breaking loose as the zombie beavers start attacking. Will the friends make it out alive and back to civilization? Or will they become the next victims of these beavers that have a taste for human blood?!</span></p>
<p><strong>The VVitch (2015)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41323" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/the-vvitch.jpg" alt="the-vvitch" width="663" height="982" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/the-vvitch.jpg 320w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/the-vvitch-203x300.jpg 203w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/the-vvitch-298x441.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this film was mostly reviewed (at least from all that I read/heard) as a total bust. “But it isn’t even scary?!” some might quip. However, what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VVitch</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does really well and why it is a pick on the list is that it is an unsettling movie. There are things that happen that just set your teeth on edge, make you cover your eyes, or put you on the verge of a panic attack. When a Thomasin and her family are cast out of their village in 1630 America, they are left to survive in the harsh wilderness. Setting up a little farm on a plot of land by the forest, things go well for a short period of time. But then when strange things start happening, the family becomes obsessed with threats of witchcraft and black magic. Is the devil lurking in the woods, making pacts with the family? Or is there just another case of witchcraft hysteria striking the family?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A young girl wakes up everyday and finds the monotony of her life utterly boring. But then she starts to realize that perhaps it isn’t just her normal life that is boring her to death. Discovering that she is stuck in a time loop and is apparently the only one aware, Lisa starts testing the boundaries of her life and how she can get out of the loop. As time continues though, will Lisa discover her way out or will she be stuck forever living as though everyday is Groundhog Day?</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Living Campaign</span></h1>
<p>New Coventry. A town located somewhere between over there and around about here. A town full of people, places and stories. Depending on who you talk to New Coventry was built on everything from fertile farming land to an ancient burial ground and was founded by pious pilgrims or lizard-headed demons. Whatever the case, New Coventry has had its share of good times and bad and it sure has a lot of stories to go around.</p>
<p>The Living Campaign series aims to bring those stories, good and bad, to the forefront. Each article will explore a new place, or a new person, or some new event that’s taken place in New Coventry. It may be something good, something not so good, or just something that the good folks of New Coventry just don’t like talking about.</p>
<p>The setting is rules agnostic, so feel free to pick and choose whatever you like, but the general feel is 1920’s small town; don’t expect too many dragons (maybe). If you’re running short on inspiration, every so often the <em>Living Campaign</em> will talk about <em>how </em>to use its various bits and pieces.</p>
<p>So with that, welcome to New Coventry stranger.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41285" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ArchivesBW.jpg" alt="archivesbw" width="1600" height="705" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ArchivesBW.jpg 1600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ArchivesBW-300x132.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ArchivesBW-768x338.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ArchivesBW-1200x529.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ArchivesBW-298x131.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ArchivesBW-620x273.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<h2><u>The Convetry Conversation Microfilm Archive</u></h2>
<p>On the third floor of the Coventry Conversation, tucked away in a corner, is the microfilm archive. A rarely used resource, except by the occasional student from the local Coventry University, the stacks of microfilm and the reader can often be found covered in a thin layer of dust.</p>
<p>The contents of the archive are, on the whole, fairly mundane. A collection of older editions of the Coventry Conversation can be found, archived in order to save space. There are a few gaps, but if one wished to one might trace the towns history in eye-grabbing headlines back nearly 20 years before encountering any great difficulty. Older editions of the Coventry Conversation are of course available, but the filing system of the microfilm is less than excellent and a student with an eye for the distant past may find themselves spending a little more time on the third floor than intended.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41287" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/journal-box.jpg" alt="journal-box" width="320" height="240" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/journal-box.jpg 320w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/journal-box-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/journal-box-298x224.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p>Also included in the archive are a variety of original architectural plans for some of the older buildings in Conventry. Several years ago there was a push to archive the delicate rolls stored in city hall and the project, like many new ideas, kicked off with a hiss and a roar. Shortly afterwards however, with the problems the mayor’s office began to face, the project was dropped in favor of more politically palatable expenditures. The project also came under fire due to the incredible inaccuracies in the microfilm. Multiple plans that were archived did not match their physical buildings, leading some to believe that the archivists were either incompetent or just stupid.</p>
<p>The only other item of note in the microfilm archive is a large, leather-bound box full of unfiled microfilm. In the flurry of city-halls archival project, many other documents were also archived in microfilm. Some that should have, some that shouldn’t have (a Johnson’s Eatery Menu for one), and of course, some documents that should have been destroyed forever.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41286" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Barnett.jpg" alt="barnett" width="360" height="241" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Barnett.jpg 360w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Barnett-300x201.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Barnett-298x199.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At GenCon 2016 Nika Howard, Brad Brockway, and I were fortunate enough to be invited to a press event for <em>Mythic Battles: Pantheon</em>, where we got a sneak peak at this intriguing upcoming miniature based tactics game.</p>
<p><em>Mythic Battles: Pantheon</em> is an miniature based game made by Mythic Games and Monolith Board Games, who you might remember from their insanely successful <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> Kickstarter.  Game Director Leonidas Vesperini explained that in the world of <em>Mythic Battles: Pantheon</em> the Titans rose up against the gods of Olympus, and while they were defeated, the world was left in ruins and the gods themselves became mortal.  As a god (Ares, Athena and more) you are vying against other gods to become the new master of Olympus and ruler of the gods.  All your favourite figures from Greek mythology are along for the party, from Achilles to Medusa.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41275" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153620.jpg" alt="20160806_153620" width="2016" height="1512" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153620.jpg 2016w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153620-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153620-768x576.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153620-1200x900.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153620-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153620-620x465.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 2016px) 100vw, 2016px" /></p>
<p><em>Mythic Battles: Pantheon</em> is for 2-4 players, and the base kit of the game contains enough material to gives you tons of replay-ability.  Along with the regular mode of play for the game, it also contains scenarios with specific goals like guarding the gates of Hell from attack.  There&#8217;s a high emphasis on the story element of the game, and there are multiple ways to win a game.</p>
<p>The thing that struck all three of us the most about <em>Mythic Battles: Pantheon</em> was the incredible effort and detail they&#8217;ve gone into for the art and design of the minis.  They&#8217;ve recruited some incredibly skilled and experienced artists for this game like Paolo Parente (Magic the Gathering) and Stefan Kopinski (Games Workshop).<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <span style="color: #333333;">The detail and artistry on the minis is incredible to look at, even in their unpainted forms they are dynamic and intricate.  The pieces in these pictures are resin, and we got to see a sample of the plastic cast minis that carry the detail over very nicely. </span></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41276" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153609.jpg" alt="20160806_153609" width="1512" height="2016" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153609.jpg 1512w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153609-225x300.jpg 225w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153609-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153609-900x1200.jpg 900w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153609-298x397.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153609-620x827.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1512px) 100vw, 1512px" /></p>
<p>Now I am not a person who plays miniature based games.  The concept of spending a massive amount of time, energy and money on collecting tiny objects that sit in a box 90% of the time just doesn&#8217;t appeal to me.  And mostly miniature based games tend to be the kind where you need to strap in and prepare for a least a few hours of play.  <em>Mythic Battles: Pantheon</em> takes 60 minutes to play, and with a starting price point of $100 for a NUMBER OF MINIS those concerns are definitely alleviated.  Rather than a focus on numbers and collecting, they&#8217;ve clearly focused on style and accessibility.  After Leonidas took us through the concept of the game and the upcoming Kickstarter, a few other members of the press present got to do a sample play.  They picked it up fairly quickly, and there were a number of interesting mechanics, particularly the dice rolling.  You can use certain dice rolls to power up other rolls, and while it was a little confusing at first it provided an interesting layer of strategy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41277" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153703.jpg" alt="20160806_153703" width="2016" height="1512" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153703.jpg 2016w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153703-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153703-768x576.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153703-1200x900.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153703-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160806_153703-620x465.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 2016px) 100vw, 2016px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve loved miniature based games for years, or if you&#8217;ve always wondered, or if you&#8217;re like me and never really been interested, I think there is something there for you in <em>Mythic Battles: Pantheon</em>.  It&#8217;s an incredibly good price point to get in on, and they have a number of excellent stretch goals and expansions planned for the Kickstarter (we got to see a few, but we can&#8217;t tell you about them).  Suffice to say that <em>Mythic Battles: Pantheon</em> oozes style and potential and if you&#8217;re interested in mythology, minis or tactics at all you should definitely watch for their Kickstarter in Fall 2016.</p>

<p>Wow, we sure did dispense justice on those Orcs. Violence isn&#8217;t always the way things should go, but in order to protect people sometimes you have to fight. If I were one to bet, violence is the only option for the way this Longcryer situation will go down. Just have to get past those sneaky guards and find the slippery weasel of a man. Then the real fun can begin.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who plays tabletop games knows there are always new gadgets and accessories to amp up the gaming experience. The ever changing and adapting market for gaming accessories has catapulted into the forefront of tabletop gaming and in the recent years, there have been more and more companies coming out to complete in this market, all vying for gamers&#8217; attention. What this means for you, the gamer, is that there is a plethora of crafted items that are available to elevate your gaming experience.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41230" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CspsZlJW8AE9pmH.jpg" alt="cspszljw8ae9pmh" width="970" height="545" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CspsZlJW8AE9pmH.jpg 970w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CspsZlJW8AE9pmH-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CspsZlJW8AE9pmH-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CspsZlJW8AE9pmH-298x167.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CspsZlJW8AE9pmH-620x348.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></p>
<p>First up, we have the newest <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1584169644/scroll-and-codex-dice-tower-and-rolling-tray?ref=profile_created" target="_blank">Kickstarter </a>from Elderwood Academy. During GenCon this year, Brad Brockway and I had the chance to meet up with Quentin and Dan, founders of Elderwood Academy. and we were able to see and experience everything they are about. During our meetup, Dan had mentioned about wanting to craft products that immerse the gamer into the game and this Kickstarter sums this up perfectly. The Scroll and Codex, respectively, are two new gaming accessories to Elderwood Academy&#8217;s product line. The Scroll is a dice rolling tray that is able to unroll and fit into the Codex for easy carrying. There are several different types of customized edges on the Scroll, as well as different designs for the leather, all available on different tiers of the Kickstarter. The Codex, is a scroll shaped wooden case, with an outer leather design that transforms into a dice rolling tower. Together, these pieces really look as though you are going on an adventuring quest!</p>

<p>People have been clamoring for a Harry Potter anime since approximately 10 minutes after the invention of animation. And here I am, knocking on your internet door to tell you the good news: all the magic of Hogwarts can be found in anime form with <em>Little Witch Academia</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_41165" style="width: 754px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-41165 " src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/littlewitch-300x169.jpg" alt="littlewitch" width="744" height="419" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/littlewitch-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/littlewitch-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/littlewitch-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/littlewitch.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yes, it&#8217;s true.</p></div>
<p><em>Little Witch Academia</em> started as a short in 2013 that Trigger produced as part of a project funding young animators. It&#8217;s a 26 minute film that tells the story of Akko, a young witch, and her friends Lotte and Sucy, at Luna Nova Magical Academy. Little Witch Academia manages to pack more creative design, style, character development, and action into 26 minutes than most shows fit into an entire season. Every minute is dripping with beautiful animation and never wastes a second on anything but fun. A successful Kickstarter campaign funded a second short film: <em>The Enchanted Parade</em>, which gave us 55 more minutes of <em>Little Witch Academia</em> goodness and expanded the world. And the good news keeps rolling: just announced is a TV show coming to a streaming service near you!</p>
<p>The world of <em>Little Witch Academia</em> is a detailed and imaginative take on your standard European vaguely medieval fantasy setting. It&#8217;s familiar enough that you can slip into it and enjoy what makes it unique and beautiful. The characters all have distinct designs and personalities, and the writing is smart and funny. Akko, Lotte, and Sucy are adorable and supportive friends even when they disagree and the background characters round out the story nicely. There&#8217;s enough unique aspects to the magic of the world to keep it interesting, especially in The Enchanted Parade when we learn there is a mundane world outside the Academy.</p>
<div id="attachment_41166" style="width: 733px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-41166 " src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Little-Witch-Academia-Akko-300x169.jpg" alt="little-witch-academia-akko" width="723" height="407" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Little-Witch-Academia-Akko-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Little-Witch-Academia-Akko-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Little-Witch-Academia-Akko-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Little-Witch-Academia-Akko-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Little-Witch-Academia-Akko-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Little-Witch-Academia-Akko.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Magic arrows, I&#8217;m in.</p></div>
<p>A short review for a short series, but you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find a more fun set of short films on Netflix and they really just need to be watched. Luna Nova Magical Academy can give Hogwarts a run for its money any day.</p>

<p>While your brave adventurers are a little on edge, you must admit that the death of a small boy is cause for alarm! Sure, it is possible that we are overreacting.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A huge couple of weeks with an incredible number of issues hitting the stands. <em>Moon Knight</em>’s latest arc kicks off, while <em>Batman</em> closes it’s first. And the wonderful <em>Bounty </em>has yet another brilliant issue.</p>

<h3>Kurtis Wiebe<br />
Mindy Lee</h3>
<p><em>Bounty</em>, after what feels like forever (though most likely just a month), is finally back. And it is of course, better than ever. One of the biggest strength’s behind one of Kurtis Wiebe’s other series, <em>Rat Queens</em>, was its characters. Each one of the Rat Queens are really badass and are characters you want to read about. Just so with <em>Bounty, </em>and this month Kurtis Wiebe takes a little time to give our heroines a little bit of a breather. After a first couple issues filled with exposition, chases and thrills, a bit of downtime is appreciated, as is the brief backstory we’re treated to. It’s not too long, but gives a good sense of where Nina’s come from, even it does raise a thousand questions as to why she was there in the first place.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41180 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bounty-extract.jpg" alt="bounty-extract" width="476" height="758" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bounty-extract.jpg 476w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bounty-extract-188x300.jpg 188w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bounty-extract-298x475.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" /></p>
<p>Speaking of questions, Wiebe does a great job this issue of making me go ‘wait a second’, with the way he teases out various details of the sci-fi world he’s created. What are the extent of Vivian’s abilities? What’s the deal with the corporations? What were the Gadflies really doing before they were brought so low? Such is the strength of Wiebe’s characters and story that I’m not frustrated at his drip-feed of information, I’m ravenously curious. The art this month is spectacular and its neon infused brilliance is not to be missed. I particularly appreciated the ‘pew’ sound-effects about half way through, and really, you should read just for that. Another stand-out issue in a stand-out series.</p>
<h3><strong><em><u>Moon Knight #6</u></em></strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_41196" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-41196" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/moon-knight-6-790x1200.jpg" alt="Moon Knight #6- Marvel" width="620" height="942" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/moon-knight-6-790x1200.jpg 790w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/moon-knight-6-198x300.jpg 198w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/moon-knight-6-768x1166.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/moon-knight-6-298x452.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/moon-knight-6-620x941.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/moon-knight-6.jpg 843w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Moon Knight #6- Marvel</p></div>
<h2>Jeff Lemire<br />
Wilfredo Torres, Francesco Francavilla, James Stokoe</h2>
<p>I’ve never been really too sure how to classify <em>Moon Knight</em>. When I first picked it up, I was expecting a typical fantasy-infused superhero story from a great writer. What unfolded was not only much better than that, but much, much stranger. That, I suppose, is this month’s issues key word; strange. If you’re not a sucker for a bending narrative and complete and utter ambiguity, stay away. The previous issue of <em>Moon Knight</em> did feel a little weak, especially near the end, but this month more than makes for it. We take a tumble through the many lives, personalities, stories and art styles of Marc Spector; all the while (just like Marc) completely unsure what is actually real. Jeff Lemire’s story is still just as confusing and compelling as it was in the first issue and despite not being fully aware of where it’s all going, it’s still a great read.</p>
<p>Shifting the story from Marc versus the world to Marc versus possibly his own mind is a great way to shake things up, and I’m excited to see where it goes from here. The art this month is nothing short of spectacular. While we may have said goodbye to Greg Smallwood’s crazy panel layouts, the switch up in art styles more than makes up for it. As the story progresses, one can only hope it happens with greater frequency. While the bizzaro narrative may not be to everyone’s taste, the sheer quality of <em>Moon Knight </em>this month can’t be doubted and now is a great time to jump on.</p>
<h2><strong><em><u>Wonder Woman #6 (Year One Part Three)</u></em></strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_41186" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-41186 size-large" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ww-cover-4-797x1200.jpg" alt="ww-cover" width="620" height="934" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ww-cover-4-797x1200.jpg 797w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ww-cover-4-199x300.jpg 199w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ww-cover-4-768x1157.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ww-cover-4-298x449.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ww-cover-4-620x934.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wonder Woman #6- DC Comics</p></div>
<h2>Greg Rucka<br />
Nicola Scott</h2>
<p>It’s almost a routine at this point. Another issue of <em>Wonder Woman</em> hits the stands, it’s amazing and wonderful and I can’t help but gush about it. This month, sorry to say, is no different. ‘Wonder Woman: Year One’ is a fantastic look at Wonder Woman’s first foray into the world of man. After the first two parts covering Diana’s last days on Themiscyria, we finally get to see her first steps (literally) into the world of man. It’s an interesting treatment with Diana immediately at odds with the world around her, not knowing how anything works, or even the language. She is of course arrested by the military and immediately confined to a cell, a fairly powerless position for such a strong hero to be in. It actually works as we then get a handful of mortals discussing Wonder Woman, providing a different perspective on her. I really enjoy this approach as it reinforces one of her key traits, for all her human-ness, Wonder Woman is still an outsider. She wasn’t raised in Kansas, or in Gotham City; Wonder Woman is well and truly an alien; and I can’t help but think that’s occasionally left by the wayside.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-41187" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ww-extract-1-804x1200.jpg" alt="ww-extract" width="620" height="925" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ww-extract-1-804x1200.jpg 804w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ww-extract-1-201x300.jpg 201w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ww-extract-1-768x1146.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ww-extract-1-298x445.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ww-extract-1-620x926.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Nicola Scott is also quickly transforming into one of my favorite artists, and her pictures this issue are top-notch. Crisp, clear lines; bold colors and a version of Diana that’s both innocent and powerful. What I really like here is that we as the audience know that, at any time, Diana could fight her way out. But she chooses not to. She’s just confused about what on earth is going on. Both storylines (Year One and The Truth) are only half-way done, and I seriously can’t wait for the next half.</p>
<h2><strong><em><u>Hal Jordan and The Green Lantern Corps #4</u></em></strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_41189" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-41189" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hj-cover-1-797x1200.jpg" alt="Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #4- DC Comics" width="620" height="934" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hj-cover-1-797x1200.jpg 797w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hj-cover-1-199x300.jpg 199w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hj-cover-1-768x1157.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hj-cover-1-298x449.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hj-cover-1-620x934.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #4- DC Comics</p></div>
<h3>Robert Vendetti<br />
Ethan Van Sciver</h3>
<p>Hold up one second, I need to check outside for blood red skies and flocks of crows as somehow a comic written by Robert Venditti was one of the best this month. But it’s true. The latest issue of <em>Hal Jordan and The Green Lantern Corps</em> (which still sounds like a sci-fi knock-off of <em>Jose and the Pussycats</em>) is actually very good. It’s an ever so slightly off-the-wall sci-fi story that, as far as I can tell, has it’s tongue firmly in its cheek.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the story is funny or ridiculous, far from it. Rather, it’s heroes are brave, it’s villains are mustache twirlers and we’re presented with a splash page of something called the fear engine. It’s both a story with a lot of heart and punch to it, while also being an issue that I can in no way take seriously. And that’s why I loved it. On top of that, Venditti seems to have finally gotten the hang of actual dialogue and the whole thing is far easier to read than some of his past work. Rounding it all off is Ethan Van Sciver’s peerless artwork. I’m probably a little biased as I already like his work, but his pencils on this month’s issue are nothing short of brilliant. There is a bizarre level of detail to his work and no less than 3 splash pages and the stylistic feel he brings helps make the issue what it is. To completely do a 180 on my previous opinion, go grab this one now.</p>

<p>Of course for such an action packed month many more things came flying into stores. Chief amongst those was the final part of the ‘I Am Gotham’ storyline in Tom King’s <em>Batman #6</em>. The storyline never sat too well with me, not feeling 100% like a Batman story. However, with this latest issue King has kicked new life into my interest in the series with a heart-felt and quite emotional send off to his first story arc. With some well executed, if predictable art and a refreshingly raw look at the effects of grief; I’m looking forward to seeing what comes next.</p>
<p>Also dropping this week is <em>Aquaman #6 </em>from Dan Abnett. Usually I’m all about the King of the Sea and his wacky capers but this week he just wasn’t up to his normal standard with just a little too much time spent dick-waving with Superman. That said, I loved the ending, and the promise of some Atlantean political machinations has me rubbing my hands in anticipation.</p>
<p>In the weirder section of the shop, <em>Paper Girls #9</em> has shimmied in from wherever it spawns from and is still as delightfully weird as it always is. Almost too much so. A great deal many answers are teased and tingled this month and more questions are raised. The story is still galloping along at a good pace, and each issue the titular paper girls become stronger characters. There is however, a real risk of the whole story collapsing under its own weirdness. Unlike <em>Moon Knight </em>which embraces ambiguity as one of its tenants, our protagonists in <em>Paper Girls </em>want answers; and so do we.</p>
<p>New, fresh and launching this month is <em>Eclipse </em>from Zack Kaplan and Image Comics, a sci-fi dystopia set in a world where the sun is a deadly threat. A good new series with a lot of thought behind the art and a compelling sci-fi murder mystery. Just a little too serious and dark for my tastes, but no doubt the perfect cup of tea for someone else.</p>

<p>Brexleyshire was supposed to be a quick pit stop but something seems strange in this simple town. While we cannot delay we also cannot forget that there is a murderer in our midst. No telling if it has anything to do with the attacked caravan or even Glaine, <em>the Jewel of the East</em>. Something sure is afoot, though, of that we are certain. Hate to be so negative, but the world still seems a broken place.</p>

<p>The Abridged Drunks and Dragons is our attempt to making getting into the DnD Podcast easier for new listeners. Episodes have been boiled down to around 10 &#8211; 20 minutes. All the important story bits, and even more important goofs and tangents have been left in for your enjoyment.</p>
<p>This original version of this episode is <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/drunks-and-dragons-episode-47-a-flying-house/">Drunks and Dragons Episode 47</a>.</p>
<h5>Synopsis from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Drunks_and_Dragons_Episodes">Drunks and Dragons Wiki</a>:</h5>
<blockquote><p>After defeating the evil troll and returning the boy to his village the gang sees a strange sight in the sky. A wooden house attached to balloons and a giant flying serpent land near them and a strange figure comes out. His introduces himself as <a title="Clinker" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Clinker">Clinker</a>, a gnome court jester to <a title="King Snuffleupagus" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=King_Snuffleupagus">King Snuffleupagus</a> and a friend of <a title="Fennekin" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Fennekin">Fennekin</a>. They initially distrust him but he tells them he will bring them to <a title="The Crypt of Sinu the Red" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=The_Crypt_of_Sinu_the_Red">The Crypt of Sinu the Red</a>. They decide to go with him and spend a few days travelling in his flying house. Clinker lands them in a small village that is completely abandoned but has a massive graveyard, far bigger than the town itself. They find a large mausoleum and go inside to find steps that go down, down down. And at the bottom of the steps there is the skeleton of a dwarf.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fans of the acclaimed author, Neil Gaiman, are in for a real treat in 2017. Arguably one of his most beloved novels will be making its appearance on the Starz network. </span><b>American Gods</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the story of a man named Shadow. After serving his time in prison, he discovers that his wife has died in a car crash. On his way to her funeral, he meets a mysterious man who refers to himself as Mr. Wednesday. Through a series of grifts and all manner of occurrences, it becomes apparent that Wednesday is actually a being of great power. A God. However, no God is omnipotent. What power they have, is gained through worship, sacrifice, and remembran</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ce.</span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-41120 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/american-gods-trailer-300x157.jpg" alt="american-gods-trailer" width="723" height="378" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/american-gods-trailer-300x157.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/american-gods-trailer-298x156.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/american-gods-trailer-620x324.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/american-gods-trailer.jpg 656w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p>Shadow struggles to keep up as Wednesday rallies his forces, in preparation for war. Unlike the old Gods, like Wednesday, who were brought to America by immigrants and were all but forgotten, the new Gods were brought into being by the American love of things like technology and media. It’s clear that neither side believes there is room in America for the other.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-41121 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/tech-boy-300x206.jpg" alt="tech-boy" width="729" height="500" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/tech-boy-300x206.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/tech-boy-298x204.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/tech-boy-620x425.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/tech-boy.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /></p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of the novel is its delving into historical fiction. It will often branch off from the main story to tell a tale of people long ago and how they came to America. It&#8217;s important, because it shows how the people who came to America brought their own beliefs with them, thus manifesting their old world’s Gods in this new and strange land. It will be interesting to see what role, if any, these types of chapters will play in the TV series.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-41122 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ag-shadowwed-300x164.jpg" alt="ag-shadowwed" width="739" height="404" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ag-shadowwed-300x164.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ag-shadowwed-768x420.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ag-shadowwed-298x163.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ag-shadowwed-620x339.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ag-shadowwed.jpg 774w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book is certainly worth a read, so I won’t say more. You should check out the author’s preferred text for an interesting appendix featuring none other than Jesus himself. If you’re into audiobooks, there’s also a full cast recording of that edition. I will say that Shadow’s character is well-developed and there is a host of other amazing characters as well. If you like character-driven narratives like </span><b>A Song of Ice and Fire</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this book might be for you. </span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-41123 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/shadow2-300x200.jpg" alt="shadow2" width="742" height="494" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/shadow2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/shadow2-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/shadow2.jpg 615w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And speaking of George R. R. Martin’s ongoing series, there’s the question of what we can expect </span><b>American Gods</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to look like after being adapted for television. First of all, take a look at the trailer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and maybe you can gauge it for yourself. </span></p>
<div class="video"><iframe width="620" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oyoXURn9oK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The casting has brokered no room for argument so far. Ian McShane will be playing Wednesday. Ricky Whittle will be playing Shadow and, judging by the trailer, I don’t think anyone will have much room to complain about him. Furthermore, it looks like most of the major roles have been cast already. So if you have read the book, you most likely don’t need to worry about your favorite God being cut from the series. One particularly interesting choice is that Gillian Anderson will play Media, the God of… well, media. </span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-41126 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gillian-ag2.jpg" alt="gillian-ag2" width="447" height="581" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Fuller is an executive producer on the show, a man known for his work on </span><b>Star Trek</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spinoffs like </span><b>Deep Space 9</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and on the upcoming </span><b>Star Trek: Discovery</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s also possible you know him from his work on </span><b>Hannibal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starz representatives have said that the show will focus more on the personal stories of various Gods. This means we can expect more in the way of diverging perspectives and less focus on Shadow himself. This should make for a more fast-paced drama suitable to the screen, since Shadow doesn’t really do a whole lot sometimes. In fact, he is completely removed from the real “action” of the story once in awhile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important thing is that fans temper their expectations. Much like </span><b>Game of Thrones</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we can’t expect </span><b>American Gods</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be a 1:1 reflection of its novel counterpart when it hits the small screen. All things considered, if you can divorce the upcoming series from the book itself, it’ll be easier to appreciate. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At GenCon 2016 I attended Pelgrane Press&#8217;s annual &#8220;State of the Pelgrane&#8221; panel and afterwards had the opportunity to talk to Co-Owner and Managing Director Cat Tobin about Pelgrane, Dracula, psychic velociraptors, women in storytelling games, and what&#8217;s new for them this year.  This is part two of a two part interview.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GI: A lot of your games are based less on dice rolling and combat mechanics and more on storytelling, like with <em>Timewatch</em> and the <em>Dracula Dossier</em>. What made you focus on that aspect of it rather than somebody sitting behind a GM screen and saying “You step into a cave”?</p>
<p>CT: One of the design goals that we have especially with our GUMSHOE games is that they&#8217;re player facing. It&#8217;s all about empowering the player to just keep the game running. And in some traditional games there&#8217;s a big power imbalance between the GM and the players, and it&#8217;s almost like they&#8217;re working against each other. Whereas in GUMSHOE the GM is your friend, the GM is the one supporting the players to create a great story. And the way they do that is that in GUMSHOE you have investigative abilities and the GM will have an investigation matrix so they will know what all the players have in terms of skill. So they will be able to say things like “Okay so you walk into this room and you notice,” cause they know your character is an architect, “That this ledge is overhanging and it&#8217;s unstable and something has dislodged that, it&#8217;s a trap.” So the GM is there feeding you information to keep the story running so it&#8217;s all about the players really. The key being that GUMSHOE is an investigative sort of system and as part of that you have to have a supportive GM otherwise it&#8217;s not going to work out. If you had a setup where the GM had all the power in that situation your mystery is not going to get very far.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>It&#8217;s crazy intense and it&#8217;s very intimate as well, because it&#8217;s really a very focused conversation between the GM and the player. So it works really well on virtual tabletops, we&#8217;ve tried playing it over Skype and over Roll20 and it works really well in those settings.</strong></h3>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-40999 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cthulhu-Confidential-cover-small-232x300-232x300.png" alt="Cthulhu-Confidential-cover-small-232x300" width="232" height="300" /></p></blockquote>
<p>GI: On that note, you guys have GUMSHOE and you have the new GUMSHOE One-2-One, it seems like a pretty interesting concept what can you tell our readers?</p>
<p>CT: GUMSHOE One-2-One came out of a conversation that I had at a convention where a couple came up to me and said “We&#8217;re really interested in playing <em>Trail of Cthulhu</em>, but we can&#8217;t get a group together, which of your adventures would you recommend for just the two of us?” and I was kind of looking at our stuff and I thought, gosh they&#8217;re all really designed around a group. You could tell people how they could hack some of it but there&#8217;s nothing really for two people. And I thought about it more, and I thought there are probably a lot of sets of two people in the world. I suggested that we could have a look at tweaking GUMSHOE for one player, one GM which is where GUMSHOE One-2-One has come from. As we mentioned in the seminar, it&#8217;s a crazy different playing experience because you don&#8217;t realize how much the other players are putting into the game until they&#8217;re taken away.</p>
<p>GI: It sounds really intense.</p>
<p>CT: It&#8217;s crazy intense and it&#8217;s very intimate as well, because it&#8217;s really a very focused conversation between the GM and the player. So it works really well on virtual tabletops, we&#8217;ve tried playing it over Skype and over Roll20 and it works really well in those settings. One of you is always talking, and you have to write a lot of adventure because with one player you actually get through a lot of material. I don&#8217;t know what your gaming group is like, but in mine there is a lot of cross table chat, and that&#8217;s a big part of it. But it also fills out the time a lot more, in a three hour session you might get an hour and a half of play. But in a session of One-2-One it&#8217;s three hours (of play) and the GM needs to prepare a lot more and have a lot more ready.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-41000 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/13thage-229x300.jpg" alt="13thage" width="229" height="300" /></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>There&#8217;s a whole community there of women designers who support each other, and we have nothing like that in the UK. So that was kind of a side goal of doing that was to create that kind of support network for women and non males who are designing in the UK</strong></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>GI: Well that&#8217;s pretty much the main overview of what I&#8217;ve got. Do you have anything else you&#8217;d like people to know about?</p>
<p>CT: Oh I should say something about <em>Seven Wonders</em>. I found <em>When the Dark is Gone</em> (a storytelling game about a group of children who visit a magical world together and return to the real world to find nobody believes them), and I really really fell in love with it and I got in touch with the author and told her, “I really love this, what are you doing with it?” and she said “I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m not really doing anything with it. What would I do with it?” and I said “Have you thought about publishing it?” and she was like “No.” And I asked, “Could I maybe publish it?” and then I thought if I was going to publish it how would I go about that? Because it&#8217;s one story game and it doesn&#8217;t really work with the rest of our stuff. And then I thought, well I could go out and try to find more of the same kind of writers and get them to write games as well. So I approached some people that I knew in the UK and got some people as well who kind of came to me and said, “Hey I heard you have this project?” We ended up with seven story games from first time writers. It&#8217;s one of those funny things as well because I never know if I should mention this, a big part of it for us is that none of the writers identify as male. And it&#8217;s something we don&#8217;t really talk about, it&#8217;s just first time writers, based in the UK, and none of them identify as male.</p>
<p>GI: That&#8217;s significant.</p>
<p>CT: Right it&#8217;s significant but it&#8217;s not a selling point. We&#8217;re not trying to capitalize on it . It just kind of happens, if you flick through the names you might notice. But it&#8217;s for me a very significant thing as well because I think particularly in the US you have a lot of women designers, particularly in the story game space, who are really creating opportunities and have a support network in place. There&#8217;s a whole community there of women designers who support each other, and we have nothing like that in the UK. So that was kind of a side goal of doing that was to create that kind of support network for women and non males who are designing in the UK and give them that sort of community to support them. So that&#8217;s a whole kind of project of mine and it&#8217;s great to see it doing so well.</p>
<p>GI: Okay, got any other hot tips for us?</p>
<p>CT: It&#8217;s our tenth anniversary of Gumshoe this year, so it&#8217;s great that we got the three core books when we release One-2-One this year it&#8217;ll be the tenth anniversary of the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At GenCon 2016 I attended Pelgrane Press&#8217;s annual &#8220;State of the Pelgrane&#8221; panel and afterwards had the opportunity to talk to Co-Owner and Managing Director Cat Tobin about Pelgrane, Dracula, psychic velociraptors, women in storytelling games, and what&#8217;s new for them this year.  This is part one of a two part interview.</p>
<hr />
<p>GI: Do you want to quickly tell us about Pelgrane Press and introduce yourself?</p>
<p>CT: Pelgrane Press is a tabletop roleplaying game company which was founded in 2002 by Simon Rogers and Sasha Bilton. It is headquartered in London and I am the co-owner and managing director along with Simon Rogers, who&#8217;s also a co-owner and managing director. We produce tabletop roleplaying games, that&#8217;s all we do. We don&#8217;t do card games, we don&#8217;t do board games, we don&#8217;t do video games, we just focus on tabletop roleplaying games. That&#8217;s what we love doing, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re passionate about, and that&#8217;s what we want to do.</p>
<p>GI: Great, so what have you guys been doing and showing here at GenCon this year?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">CT: What we&#8217;ve got here at GenCon is the deliverables for two really big Kickstarters. So the first one of those is the <em>Dracula Dossier</em>, which I worked quite closely with Kenneth Hite and Gareth Ryder-Hanrahan on, and basically that takes the premise that the original novel of Dracula is real. Dracula the novel is a redacted version of what happened which MI6 redacted and released as misinformation because they tried to recruit Dracula as a spy to work for them. We&#8217;ve got <em>Dracula Unredacted</em> which is the novel but we&#8217;ve added back in the redacted characters so we&#8217;ve got some extra characters in it. And we&#8217;ve added about 25% that MI6 took out. That book has also been annotated by three generations of MI6 analysts, so they&#8217;ve got through it in their attempts to track down Dracula and potentially hire him again; they&#8217;ve gone through it and they&#8217;ve made annotations in the margins of the book.  This is the ultimate player handout, you hand them this unredacted version of the Dracula novel and say “Where do you want to go?”</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>And you can play any kind of character, there&#8217;s a psychic Velociraptor, an uplifted ape, you can play people from the very, very far future. There&#8217;s epic scope to design your kind of agent.</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>You find this artifact, open it up, pick a clue and investigate that. And we&#8217;ve got another book which is the <em>Director&#8217;s Handbook</em> which gives you all of the information you need about the clues you will find in <em>Dracula Unredacted</em>. It&#8217;s an epic sandbox campaign and they&#8217;re the kind of two core books in it.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-40995 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/edomfiles-236x300.png" alt="edomfiles" width="236" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/edomfiles-236x300.png 236w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/edomfiles-298x378.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/edomfiles.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" /></p>
<p>Also relatively new at the show, we&#8217;ve got the <em>Edom Files</em>, which is a collection of adventures for the <em>Dracula Dossier</em>. So if you didn&#8217;t want to get into the epic sandbox campaign they&#8217;re much easier to just pick up and play. We&#8217;ve also got the <em>Edom Field Manual</em>, and that&#8217;s the organization within MI6 that is responsible for maintaining and managing the vampire assets, it&#8217;s called Edom. So the <em>Edom Field Manual</em> tells you what it&#8217;s like to be on the inside of Edom. It&#8217;s like an army training manual for Edom and it&#8217;s got lots of NPCs. There&#8217;s also the <em>Thrill of Dracula</em>, where Kenneth Hite has basically taken all of the Dracula literature and watched all of the films and he basically tells you how to incorporate the wealth of Dracula film and literature out there and bring that into your game. So that&#8217;s one of the two Kickstarter related sets of books that we&#8217;ve got out.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em> So this is the ultimate player handout, you hand them this unredacted version of the Dracula novel and say “Where do you want to go?”</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>The other one is <em>TimeWatch</em> which we&#8217;re all very, very excited about. <em>TimeWatch</em> is a GUMSHOE game, so it&#8217;s investigative, and you play time agents who are trying to protect the timelines. They investigate anomalies and paradoxes in the timeline, across all timelines.</p>
<p>And you can play any kind of character, there&#8217;s a psychic Velociraptor, an uplifted ape, you can play people from the very, very far future. There&#8217;s epic scope to design your kind of agent.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-40996 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/TimeWatch-cover-300-231x300.png" alt="TimeWatch-cover-300" width="231" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/TimeWatch-cover-300-231x300.png 231w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/TimeWatch-cover-300-298x386.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/TimeWatch-cover-300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also got <em>Behind Enemy Times</em>, which is again an adventure collection for that so it just teaches you a bit of how to design your own adventures for <em>TimeWatch</em>. And we&#8217;ve also got the <em>Book of Changing Years</em> which is effectively a Wikipedia of the timeline so it kind of takes lots of different events along the timeline and fills them out a bit. And each of those events is a plot hook that you can use to create adventures.</p>
<p>Also new at the show,  we&#8217;ve got <em>Fear Itself Second Edition</em> which I&#8217;m really excited about. We&#8217;re taking and revamping <em>Fear Itself</em> which is a GUMSHOE game of interpersonal horror. So you know kind of slasher movies, somebody&#8217;s in the house, nobody knows anything about the supernatural and suddenly these things start attacking them, weird things start happening and they have to try and figure out what&#8217;s going on. So that&#8217;s the kind of premise of <em>Fear Itself</em> and the second edition basically takes that setting and the core rules and adds a load of GM advice to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>But where in Fear Itself you play an ordinary person that has no experience with the supernatural, in The Esoterrorists you play an agent from what&#8217;s called the Ordo Veritatis and you know about all the weird stuff.</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>There are different ways you can run it, you can run it as a one shot, or as a miniseries or as a campaign, and there&#8217;s an example of each of those in the book. The important thing it does is it teaches you how to structure plots for each of those, how to design characters that are impacted by the length of time that you&#8217;re running.</p>
<p>Like obviously if you&#8217;re running a one shot you need them to be a lot more focused in terms of the horror they&#8217;re experiencing whereas over a campaign you have more time to play around with the pacing of it. We&#8217;ve got great feedback so far about the GM advice in <em>Fear Itself Second Edition</em> and how it can be used to run any horror game.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-40997 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fearitself.jpg" alt="fearitself" width="220" height="285" /></p>
<p>The last book we have is new at the show and is called <em>Worldbreaker</em> and that&#8217;s a globe spanning campaign for our very first GUMSHOE book which is called T<em>he Esoterrorists</em>. <em>The Esoterrorists</em> and<em> Fear Itself</em> are both set in the same universe. But where in <em>Fear Itself</em> you play an ordinary person that has no experience with the supernatural, in T<em>he Esoterrorists</em> you play an agent from what&#8217;s called the Ordo Veritatis and you know about all the weird stuff. They&#8217;re the super competent agents who burst through the door when the <em>Fear Itself</em> people are going “Oh no, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on!”. They&#8217;ll take out the monsters and seal what we call “holes in the membrane” which separates our world from the world of the Outer Dark where all the creatures of unremitting horror live and are trying to get through.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Obviously it is amazing to win awards but for us the biggest one was the Fan Favorite Publisher which was really, really special to me because our fans are incredible people. </em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>The eponymous Esoterrorists are almost likes cultists who are working with the creatures of unremitting horror to try and open holes in the membrane. Which they do by feeding into beliefs and taking weird phenomenon and using that to create holes in the membrane. So <em>Worldbreaker</em> has five different locations so you have to travel and resolve almost a standalone adventure in each location and while each stands alone there is an overarching plot where this one group of Esoterrorists are trying to create a massive breach.</p>
<p>GI: You guys have got a lot of stuff! That&#8217;s exciting! Last night at the ENnie Awards you guys pretty much cleaned up, what was that like?</p>
<p>CT: Yeah, somebody said to me, which I thought was really funny and I guess is kind of true, is that we were nominated for ten ENnies and we won eleven. Because basically in one of the categories: <em>the 13<sup>th</sup> Age</em> GM Screen was nominated and we published that but a partner that we worked with for the <em>Dracula Dossier</em> who made the amazing dicebags for it, they were also nominated in the same category.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously it is amazing to win awards but for us the biggest one was the Fan Favourite Publisher which was really, really special to me because our fans are incredible people. You know they&#8217;ve come out in numbers to support us and everything we do, we do for them. It was really, really touching to win that.</p>
<p>Also Product of the Year was pretty great.</p>
<p>GI: Yeah that&#8217;s a pretty good double whammy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GenCon is labeled as the “best four days in gaming” and with the abundance of boardgames, tabletop, card, and many other types of games, Indianapolis becomes a gamer’s Mecca. This being my second year attending GenCon, I felt that I had a good handle on what was around the convention and with my group, we made plans for games to play and booths not to be missed. As we walked through the exhibit hall though, I came to realize that GenCon is an ever-changing beast and I was surprised with new and exciting games and booths that have yet to leave my gaming dreams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that seems to have grown in popularity in the past few years is the increase of luxury gaming accessories and even “prestige” or “boutique” games. These accessories and games are evolving the way people can game, elevating the experience to something that becomes more immersive and helps to create a tangible world for the gamer. There were several booths that I stopped by that grabbed my attention including the following new and familiar items.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40735" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160804_152958-2.jpg" alt="20160804_152958" width="1286" height="1150" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160804_152958-2.jpg 1286w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160804_152958-2-300x268.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160804_152958-2-768x687.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160804_152958-2-1200x1073.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160804_152958-2-298x266.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160804_152958-2-620x554.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1286px) 100vw, 1286px" /></p>
<p>One of the games that I most desperately wished to walk away from GenCon with, was “Kingdom Death: Monster”. <a href="http://kingdomdeath.com/" target="_blank">“Kingdom Death: Monster”</a> calls itself a “nightmare horror board game” and the miniature figures for the game do not fail to uphold this description. The game itself is a survival, character building experience where the players cooperatively fight together to beat monsters, obtain gear, and upgrade your character. Along with trying to just survive, players are able to build, maintain, and expand a settlement under their control.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40993" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kingdom_death_monster_00.jpg" alt="kingdom_death_monster_00" width="1920" height="931" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kingdom_death_monster_00.jpg 1920w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kingdom_death_monster_00-300x145.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kingdom_death_monster_00-768x372.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kingdom_death_monster_00-1200x582.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kingdom_death_monster_00-298x144.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kingdom_death_monster_00-620x301.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Looking over the game, it is hard not to fall in awe of the insanely detailed miniature figures that evoke a feeling of amazement and sheer horror. The base game itself is hard to find and currently not available for sale on the website. It was in stock during GenCon, so stalking out conventions may be the best bet for nabbing this collector’s game. The base game comes in at $400 with expansions for individual characters starting at $25 and expansions for monsters ranging from $50-150.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40736" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Geek-Chic-Custom-Gaming-Table.jpg" alt="Geek Chic Custom Gaming Table" width="600" height="305" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Geek-Chic-Custom-Gaming-Table.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Geek-Chic-Custom-Gaming-Table-300x153.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Geek-Chic-Custom-Gaming-Table-298x151.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>So now that you have the luxury game, what do you use to play? Well standard fair is whatever flat surface the group can gather around and set up the game, but for the luxury gamer; the options are endless. Geek Chic offers some of the best of the best tables designed specifically for all your gaming needs. These tables offer hidden drawers perfect for character sheets, writing utensils, gaming books, and other accessories. Many of the tables also have the option for a top that can be removed, leaving a recessed area for figurines or games to stay set up and out of the way while the table is being used for other things. Geek Chic tables offered range from full dining tables, coffee tables, game room specific tables, storage options for gaming peripheries, and even chairs to match. All of these products can be customized through different wood options and they even offer the ability for customized tables. Most items available for order can be ordered through <a href="https://www.geekchichq.com/" target="_blank">Geek Chic’s website</a>, with several requiring a deposit.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40738" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jack-Daniels-Oak-Polyhedral-Dice.jpg" alt="Jack-Daniels-Oak-Polyhedral-Dice" width="863" height="485" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jack-Daniels-Oak-Polyhedral-Dice.jpg 863w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jack-Daniels-Oak-Polyhedral-Dice-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jack-Daniels-Oak-Polyhedral-Dice-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jack-Daniels-Oak-Polyhedral-Dice-298x167.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jack-Daniels-Oak-Polyhedral-Dice-620x348.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px" /></p>
<p>The last thing to really round out a fully immersive luxury gaming experience would not be complete without the gaming accessories. From custom dice boxes to dice made of rare woods and materials, the options for high end gaming gear is nearly endless. One of the well known dice making companies, Artisan Dice, were again present with a few new options in their product line. There are several different woods at GenCon, including dice sets made from “Jack Daniels” barrels, and, as a great pairing, d20s made from whiskey stones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also had the chance to stop in to Dog Might’s booth and check out what new things were coming up and ask about their beautiful “Settlers of Catan” custom board. For anyone looking into ways to take their games to the next level, this board is the perfect thing. Handmade and painted, this board gives players an option where not only do the tiles actually fit together, but it brings the game to life for all the trading of sheep, ore, etc. Michael and Michael, co-founders, shared with me plans for their next Kickstarter item “War Quarters”, which can be customized like the “Dragon Sheaths”, but will be for carrying miniature figures along with other gaming gear. Make sure to keep an eye out for a follow up article, closer to the Kickstarter release date! Another gaming accessory that stood out to us was Elderwood Academy for their beautifully crafted hex chests and spellbook dice cases. These, especially the spellbook dice cases, allow for the immersion of the player into their character and as such, make great gaming accessories for those who enjoy playing magic based characters. These spellbook cases also had interior options for card decks, making them perfect for &#8220;Magic the Gathering&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40737" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/catan_board_game_upgrades_by_dog_might_008.jpg" alt="catan_board_game_upgrades_by_dog_might_008" width="992" height="524" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/catan_board_game_upgrades_by_dog_might_008.jpg 992w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/catan_board_game_upgrades_by_dog_might_008-300x158.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/catan_board_game_upgrades_by_dog_might_008-768x406.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/catan_board_game_upgrades_by_dog_might_008-298x157.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/catan_board_game_upgrades_by_dog_might_008-620x328.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px" /></p>
<p>Gaming is definitely a hobby and pastime that is great and entertaining for everyone. No matter what the budget is, there is a way to fit gaming into the equation. However, recent years have shown an increase in items that craft and create a more immersive environment for gaming. Whether is having highly-detailed miniature sculpts to up your role-playing game, playing your games on customized gaming tables, or owning artisan crafted gaming accessories, these products are sure to bring your games to life in a way takes gaming to the next level. These items, either being used all together, or working what pieces you can into your budget, stand out as heirloom items that after a while, not only look beautiful, but carry a story as memorable as the gaming experience of the player.</p>

<p>This original version of this episode is <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/drunks-and-dragons-episode-45-troll-toll/">Drunks and Dragons Episode 45</a>.</p>
<h5>Synopsis from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Drunks_and_Dragons_Episodes">Drunks and Dragons Wiki</a>:</h5>
<blockquote><p>The party resumes fighting <a title="Dungarth" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Dungarth">Dungarth</a> and it&#8217;s a little touch and go. Thom seduces the fuck out of the troll with his new magic amulet. Harper and Aludra take some nasty damage but Thom&#8217;s new bard powers keep them going. The episode ends before the end of combat, making this combat the only one to span 3 episodes.</p></blockquote>

<p>I love the feeling that you get when you start a new adventure! As adventurers moving on to the next big quest is pretty much our job. Saving the world one evil cult or murderous monster at a time. But, it is always important to use these transition times to reflect and to grow closer with your team. There won&#8217;t be time to chat once the arrows are flying or when you are being devoured by an ancient worm.</p>
<p>The adventure continues with Titus Harper (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/timlanning">Tim Lanning</a>), Jett Razor (<a href="https://twitter.com/themikebachmann">Mike Bachmann</a>), Aludra (<a href="https://twitter.com/jennifercheek">Jennifer Cheek</a>), Jaela (<a href="https://twitter.com/Nika_Howard">Nika Howard</a>) and your Dungeon Master (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/thriftynerd">Michael DiMauro</a>). Editing help this week comes from David L.

<h5>Synopsis from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Drunks_and_Dragons_Episodes">Drunks and Dragons Wiki</a>:</h5>
<blockquote><p>Battered but not beaten by the storm, the party lands in <a title="Medwyn" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Medwyn">Medwyn</a> before reaching <a title="Keshai" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Keshai">Keshai</a> to restock and repair. Upon landing they are greeted by a group of women and children in very traditional dress. They are amazed at the sight of the party, having rarely met outsiders. It all seems to be going really well until an old <a title="+5 Old Codgers" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=%2B5_Old_Codgers">codger</a> shows up. He introduces himself as the village elder <a title="Krint" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Krint">Krint</a> and promptly tells them to get out. He denies them any supplies and tells them they can&#8217;t even keep the boat there. <a title="Thom the Dragonborn" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Thom_the_Dragonborn">Thom</a> tries to convince Krint that they are long lost brothers, which is (shockingly) unsuccessful. <a class="mw-redirect" title="Lord Titus Harper" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lord_Titus_Harper">Harper</a> then gets all nobility on everybody by promising to give them 500 GP, because he has no concept of money.</p></blockquote>

<p>Back when I first envisioned the concept of this column, there were a few shows that I knew I wanted to do and <em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em> is one of them. I barely remembered anything about it, but it stuck out to me as a particularly iconic magical girl show. And I think I&#8217;m not alone in that, since Kym Stonick made my included Sakura in the awesome banner art she made for me. Sakura pops up constantly in magical girl themed material and I would argue that most people would recognize elements from the show. So while watching it this month, I tried to figure out what made it so memorable when I could barely remember the plot. What I settled on is that the incredible design sensibilities of the show are what made it stand the test of time, almost 20 years later.</p>
<div id="attachment_41080" style="width: 1178px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-41080" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cardcaptor-sakura-wallpaper-image-01-300x179.png" alt="Don't pretend you don't recognize that wand." width="1168" height="697" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cardcaptor-sakura-wallpaper-image-01-300x179.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cardcaptor-sakura-wallpaper-image-01-298x177.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cardcaptor-sakura-wallpaper-image-01.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Don&#8217;t pretend you don&#8217;t recognize that wand.</p></div>
<p><em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em> (<em>Cardcaptors</em> in the English dub) started as a manga for younger children than my usual shows. Sakura is a fourth grade student who inadvertently releases a book of Clow Cards, each of which holds a powerful and specific power. She must recapture each card and seal it back into card form to become the new master of the cards and keep them from wreaking havoc on her city. The manga was made into an anime that lasted for three seasons. There is actually a new manga coming sometime next year with Sakura now in seventh grade, but not much is known other than that. <em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em> was another victim of heavy cutting and localization when it came to North America. The seventy episodes of the original were condensed into just 39 English episodes, with the tone and content of the show vastly altered. <em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em> is a light show about magic and has an innocence to it. It&#8217;s about the adventures of a girl who is still a child but growing and learning that there is much more to her world.  Unlike most of us at that age, she happens to have to deal with powerful magic forces.  The English dub is much more of an ensemble action show, with a dramatic new theme song and much less focus on romance and, in classic 90s dub fashion, any vestige of LGBT relationships were wiped out.</p>
<p>There are two main design features of <em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em> that really make it stand out from the crowd of both 90s animes and magical girl animes: the card designs and Sakura&#8217;s costumes. The Clow Cards obviously mirror Tarot cards, both in design and style. The creators were actually somewhat inspired by <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, which was gaining popularity in Japan at the time. The cards are mostly themed around elements like The Firey or The Windy, but there are others like The Jump, The Sword, and The Return. Each card is unique and intricately designed and executed within the show. The cards are the real star of the show, I found myself waiting anxiously each episode to see what form the card would take. In turn, Sakura&#8217;s uses for the cards are creative and interesting, allowing her to tackle her encounters more as puzzles than fights.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-41081 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/clowcards-300x225.jpg" alt="clowcards" width="713" height="535" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/clowcards-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/clowcards-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/clowcards.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p>The second element of the show that shines is Sakura&#8217;s costumes. Sakura&#8217;s best friend Tomoyo is her biggest cheerleader from long before she becomes the Cardcaptor. In the original Tomoyo is actually in love with Sakura, but never pursues it strongly because she knows Sakura doesn&#8217;t feel the same way. She is always the most excited to see and support Sakura, and she also happens to love dressing Sakura up in costumes for her card hunts. Tomoyo films Sakura chasing and capturing the cards in an array of outfits that she sews for her. It&#8217;s a running goof that Sakura isn&#8217;t particularly pleased with these outfits, but does it to humor Tomoyo. The outfits are incredibly designed, each one is different but with a fairly consistent visual theme of wings, round shapes, and a lot of capes. Each episode becomes a unique visual treat, with the different cards and costumes providing enough variety to break up the fairly standard monster of the week format. Plus, it soothes the part of my soul that really wants transformation sequences in every show ever.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-41082 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sakura-241x300.jpg" alt="sakura" width="681" height="848" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sakura-241x300.jpg 241w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sakura-298x371.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sakura.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></p>
<p><em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em> is also notable for it&#8217;s use of LGBT relationships, at least in the original and not the dub. The creators actually have said that what they wanted to do is show different types of relationships and love, which of course includes LGBT ones. The amount of unrequited love going around is kind of ridiculous, with every single main character having some sort of secret crush on another. Tomoyo loves Sakura who loves Yukito who loves Toya, and Meilin loves Syaoran who also loves Sakura. It&#8217;s all very innocent romantic love, with sex basically playing no part in the show, what with most of the characters being 9 year olds. There&#8217;s an excellent bit in the third season where Nakuru, the human alias of Ruby Moon, explains to a number of characters that it doesn&#8217;t really matter if she&#8217;s into girls or guys since she isn&#8217;t technically a woman or a man. It&#8217;s a nice little bit of genderfluid representation that you don&#8217;t see in a lot of kids shows even now.</p>
<p>The monster of the week plot structure can get fairly stale after a while, although things definitely get mixed up a lot come the third season. But the non monster of the week episodes are consistently interesting, well written and advance the plot in spades. That coupled with the fantastic visuals make the show interesting to keep watching, especially if you&#8217;re like me and never saw the original.</p>

<h3>Greg Rucka<br />
Liam Sharp</h3>
<p>Greg Rucka has made a truly excellent decision in deciding to tell two separate stories with <em>Wonder Woman</em>. This week we’re getting ‘The Lies- Part Three’ as <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/tag/wonder-woman/">Wonder Woman</a> attempts to discover who or what exactly has obfuscated details about her past. Concurrent to that is Steve Trevor stumbling upon an attempt to resurrect an ancient god in the very same jungle that Wonder Woman is exploring. Coincidence that.</p>
<p>The story thus far has been the high quality stuff we’ve come to expect from the series, and issue 5 is no exception. A little more detail and foreshadowing is given at the very start of the issue with a brief return to America, and it is nice to have the stories pace changed up a little and, even for just a moment, anchor itself in the real world. Full respect to Wonder Woman of course, but she’s not really the hero in this issue. Instead it’s my boy Steve Trevor who does a stand-up job of just being the emotionally mature, All-American solidery bad-ass that he is. Rucka presents a well thought out, if incredibly unsubtle dialogue between Steve and Cadulo around the idea of modern masculinity. It’s hardly mind-bending, earth-shaking stuff, but it does provide a good base for Steve and really advances his character beyond the typical gun wielding solider.</p>
<div id="attachment_41033" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-41033 size-large" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wonder-Woman-Extract-3-801x1200.jpg" alt="Liam Sharp on display" width="620" height="929" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wonder-Woman-Extract-3-801x1200.jpg 801w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wonder-Woman-Extract-3-200x300.jpg 200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wonder-Woman-Extract-3-768x1150.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wonder-Woman-Extract-3-298x446.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wonder-Woman-Extract-3-620x928.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Liam Sharp on display</p></div>
<p>Mention also has to go to Liam Sharp’s simply incredibly fantastic artwork. There just seems to be such a high level of care and skill in it that looking at it is an actual pleasure. There is a certain, twisted, mystical quality to it that really suits the story and also completely sets itself apart from ‘Wonder Woman- Year One’. Perhaps a case could be made to say that ‘Year One’ is a stronger story, but really, with both being so bloody good, it just doesn’t matter.</p>
<h2><strong><em><u>Clean Room #11</u></em></strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_41027" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-41027" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clean-Room-11-780x1200.jpg" alt="Clean Room #11- Vertigo" width="620" height="954" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clean-Room-11-780x1200.jpg 780w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clean-Room-11-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clean-Room-11-768x1181.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clean-Room-11-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clean-Room-11-620x953.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clean-Room-11.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Clean Room #11- Vertigo</p></div>
<h3>Gail Simone<br />
Jon Davis-Hunt</h3>
<p>There isn’t much I can say about Gail Simone’s sci-fi/horror that, despite 11 issues, still manages to make me uncomfortable while also drawing me into the story. Rest assured this latest outing is just as good as what’s come before, if not better. The story is especially tight this month with a lot of <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/tag/clean-room/">Clean Room’s</a> normal careful pace dropped in favor of an issue that springs from point to point. This is in no way a criticism with Astrid’s retreat, Sparks fate, Duncan’s betrayal and the coup of Astrid’s company by a charlatanistic evangelical organization all rearing their narrative heads.</p>
<p>The issue, and story, needs a bit of pep and vigor and this one delivers. There hasn’t been a large amount of traditional action (y’know, guns and punching) in <em>Clean Room </em>thus far, but issue 11 doles out just the right amount. There is of course a healthy dollop of political intrigue to round the whole thing out, and I gained a certain amount of satisfaction from seeing John Davis-Hunt finally draw Astrid’s eyebrows in a furious, plotting scowl once more. What keeps me coming back to <em>Clean Room </em>time and time again is the complexity of… whatever it is that Gail Simone has created here. It’s almost as if Simone is telling two stories, one is one what’s happening in real time, and the other is the slow discovery of how things really work. Her drip feeding of that second story is incredibly masterful and is on full display this month. Any kind of comic-reading fan of sci-fi or just odder than usual stories simply has to jump on the <em>Clean Room</em> ride.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41043" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Honourable-Mentions.jpg" alt="Honourable Mentions" width="3508" height="2480" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Honourable-Mentions.jpg 3508w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Honourable-Mentions-300x212.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Honourable-Mentions-768x543.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Honourable-Mentions-1200x848.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Honourable-Mentions-298x211.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Honourable-Mentions-620x438.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 3508px) 100vw, 3508px" /></p>
<p><em>Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps </em>from Robert Venditti has finally dragged itself up after a couple of lackluster first issues. Issue 3 is really more of a step in the right direction with a good dose of sci-fi action, some cool aliens and the beginnings of a fairly interesting story. Is it ground-breaking stuff? Not in the slightest, but I’m not really expecting it to be. I’m finally enjoying Venditti’s <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/tag/green-lantern/">Hal Jordan</a> who seems to have thankfully progressed from a petulant weirdo into the determined, will-power filled hero we all know and love. A series to watch, if a little cautiously.</p>
<p>Also on the radar this week is <em>The Hellblazer #1</em> that just hit the shelves. Unfortunately, my local shop was fresh out so I had to content myself with <em>The Hellblazer: Rebirth</em>. Which was hardly a sad affair with a fairly cracking, amusing fantasy story tucked away inside. My experience with Hellblazer and <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/tag/constantine/">John Constantine</a> is general is fairly limited but the story of a cockney-ish sorcerer defeating a demon in London while cracking a bunch of jokes is a good one. Constantine is, at times, genuinely funny and the dark fantasy vibe is unlike anything else I read. Not quite solid enough on the writing front to hook me in, but enough to keep an eye out for the trade.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it from me this time, what are you reading this week? Leave a comment or hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/mrk_bennett">twitter</a>!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>River Page wants to be a Grace. Within a few weeks of moving to a new town on the edge of the sea, it&#8217;s all she wants and all she can think about. She plans her days around them and daydreams about what it might be like, to be accepted by the mystical, magical children of the most powerful family in town.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for her, the three Grace siblings—Summer, Thalia, and Fenrin—don&#8217;t have any idea who she is. Well, maybe they know that she&#8217;s the new girl, the quiet girl, the one who escapes to the library to read during lunch. But they don&#8217;t know how much she wants to belong to them, to participate in their world. Because the Graces are magic. Rumors are everywhere about the mishaps that befall their enemies and the blessings they can bring to their friends. The beautiful, bewitching Graces. The beautiful, bewitching Fenrin in particular, whom River has been in love with from afar almost since she first saw him.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-39220" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dd70d23e0b2243b5ed5d5fc863eedd18-199x300.jpg" alt="dd70d23e0b2243b5ed5d5fc863eedd18" width="285" height="430" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dd70d23e0b2243b5ed5d5fc863eedd18-199x300.jpg 199w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dd70d23e0b2243b5ed5d5fc863eedd18-298x450.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dd70d23e0b2243b5ed5d5fc863eedd18-620x937.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dd70d23e0b2243b5ed5d5fc863eedd18.jpg 662w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></p>
<p>Slowly, from a combination of devotion, calculation, and a little of her own mysterious luck, River begins to ingratiate herself with the siblings. She hangs out with Summer, drinking homebrewed wine and watching horror movies. And casting spells. Spells that may or may not work, spells that have as much to do with faith as they do with ritual, spells that even the Graces tout a true one minute and hoaxes the next. But River knows its true. It must be true. The Graces are magic, but they&#8217;re under a curse. And River&#8217;s going to be the one who breaks it.</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t <em>like</em> River. She&#8217;s both too eager and too secretive. Friendship is a calculation to her, about what she can get out of it more than about its intrinsic worth. Power motivates her more than love. Much ink has been spilled about the relative likability of female characters and what that says about our expectations for women, but for me it&#8217;s much more personal (and thus, not really a criticism so much as a confession). I don&#8217;t like what she reflects about me, the reader. Many of us nerds were outcasts growing up, or at least felt like we were outside looking in. And doubtless many of us wanted the magic powers we read about and played in video games, powers that would let us get what we wanted and yet retain the image we had of ourselves as both virtuous and benevolent. After all, the good guys are the ones with powers. The good guys do things for the right reasons, and everything always turns out well in the end.</p>
<p>Are the Graces really <em>good?</em> Is River? The answer keeps shifting with every new fact we learn about the Grace family and with every spell they cast. But are they even really witches? Or are they just the rich and beautiful kind of powerful, no magic beyond charisma? River wants so desperately to believe that they have Powers with a capital P, not just the cultural inheritance of witchcraft the way some people inherit being Catholic or Jewish. It&#8217;s this burning hope that really got to me in the end. It&#8217;s incandescent and furious, both a pleasure and a creeping horror to read. Hope like that is a wildfire, taking everything&#8211;even trouble&#8211;for fuel and burning everyone in the end.</p>
<p>Yet I also have a great pity—maybe even compassion—for River. She&#8217;s alone. She&#8217;s neglected. There&#8217;s nothing romantic about her poverty or exciting about the freedom her absent mother gives her. Wanting friends to fill the huge voids in her life isn&#8217;t selfish; it&#8217;s just the way that she goes about it that&#8217;s suspect. She&#8217;s compelling, which ultimately is more important than likability.</p>
<p>Likability also isn&#8217;t equivalent to readability, and this book was infinitely readable. For the last third of it, I started reading the moment I woke up, and when I could no longer ignore the need for breakfast, I walked to a pastry shop with my nose to the screen the entire time, there and back. <em>I did not even eat my cookie until I was done</em>. That&#8217;s the kind of urgency this book contains. It&#8217;s a psychological thriller even more than it is a fantasy novel, an it&#8217;ll put a spell on you, too.</p>
<p><em>The Graces</em> by Laure Eve comes out September 6.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello! I’m back once again to give you my first impressions on an Anime that Transformation Sequence likely won’t have time to cover in full. As a reminder, what I consider a first impression of a show is watching the first three episodes. This gives the show time to introduce the world, the characters, the driving plot, and the antagonists. This week, I want to talk about <i>Alderamin on the Sky</i>.</p>
<div class="video"><iframe width="620" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wm07R0s--nI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><em>Alderamin on the Sky</em> is a military fantasy show. I know some of you might have tuned out at the idea of a military anime, but stick with me. We follow a cast of characters through their time in the military training academy of their country, with an emphasis on Ikta and Yatorishino, as they rise through the ranks. The show is back dropped by this narrator who keeps referring to Ikta as the greatest military general of all time. Heads up folks, this is one to watch.</p>
<div id="attachment_40981" style="width: 757px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-40981" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin_01_1.jpg" alt="This is me, making you watch this anime" width="747" height="420" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin_01_1.jpg 640w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin_01_1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin_01_1-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin_01_1-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">This is me, making you watch this anime</p></div>
<p>There is a lot going for this show on the positive end. I really like the two main characters I mentioned above. They are close in the show and their dynamic is interesting to watch. Ikta is a &#8216;womanizer&#8217;, extremely lazy, and can sometimes forget his place in this royal hierarchy based world. Yatoshi, however, is stern and no-nonsense, so when Ikta gets out of line, she is there to straighten him out. I don&#8217;t want to give too much away about them, as I think just seeing the relationship between them play out is much more effective.</p>
<div id="attachment_40984" style="width: 736px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-40984" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin-02.jpg" alt="That's right. She has TWO swords. " width="726" height="718" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin-02.jpg 640w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin-02-300x297.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin-02-75x75.jpg 75w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin-02-298x295.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin-02-620x613.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">That&#8217;s right. She has TWO swords.</p></div>
<p>Another big plus this show has on its side is that Madhouse is producing it. These are the same hot boys and girls that brought you <em>Ninja Scroll, Paprika</em>, and <em>Death Parade</em>, among many others. The rest of the production team is solid as well. I bring up Madhouse because they are the reason this show caught my eye in the first place. The studio rarely produces duds so I figured this show would be at least good, if not great. So far, it&#8217;s shaping up to be the latter.</p>
<div id="attachment_40985" style="width: 737px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-40985" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin-03.jpg" alt="&quot;Lemme get in that grill&quot; - Ikta" width="727" height="434" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin-03.jpg 610w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin-03-300x179.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alderamin-03-298x178.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Lemme get in that grill&#8221; &#8211; Ikta</p></div>
<p>I do have a few gripes with the first three episodes. I am a little nervous about how Ikta is going to play out as a &#8216;womanizer.&#8217; I hope they drop that schtick soon because it could lead to some creepiness down the line. I also want more fleshing out of the other three main characters other than some bullet points. I know it&#8217;s just the first three episodes so we weren&#8217;t going to get a lot about them, but I&#8217;m hoping they give them some quiet character moments with Ikta or Yatoshi so we can get to know them too.</p>
<div class="video"><iframe width="620" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l3lQu2DVuh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Overall, <em>Alderamin on the Sky</em> is a fun show with a lot of potential. It&#8217;s main characters are interesting by themselves and their interactions are fun to see. The setting is supremely interesting in how the fantasy aspect plays into the military sides of things. Definitely add this one to your queue!</p>

<p>You! You following the spiders &#8211; are YOU the heir of Slytherin?! No? Well, we had to try because we are <em>stumped</em> as to who it could be.</p>
<p>This week, we find ourselves in the wrong place at the wrong time, maybe sort of accidentally kill a cat? No. Petrify. We learn about polyjuice potion and BUM BUM BUMMM The Chamber of Secrets. And we ask callers to give us their theories on who might be the Heir of Slytherin, with&#8230;interesting results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of you are probably aware of the market for furniture made specifically for gaming. Companies like Geek Chic have made their name by offering products are meant to enhance your gaming experience. If you&#8217;ve ever wandered through convention halls, you&#8217;ve probably seen their booth. Then you see the price tag. Even the simplest model will cost you four figures, and deluxe game tables, like their Sultan model (pictured below) can cost up to $25,ooo when all is said and done!</p>
<p>It may surprise you to read that I have never really considered dropping that kind of cash on a table. Despite my incredible eloquence which may make you think otherwise, I just don&#8217;t have that kind of money laying around. Not to disparage the companies making these tables. They are incredibly well-crafted, beautiful pieces. And for most of us they&#8217;re just a dream.</p>
<div id="attachment_39198" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-39198" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Sultan1-300x200.png" alt="I don't say this often, but it really is a sexy table." width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Sultan1-300x200.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Sultan1.png 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Sultan1-298x199.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I don&#8217;t say this often, but it really is a sexy table.</p></div>
<p>Something changed for me recently. I came across <a href="https://www.boardgametables.com/about">BoardGameTables.com</a>&#8216;s The Duchess on Kickstarter, and for the first time I&#8217;m actually imagining having a bonafide gaming table in my home. I will forewarn you by saying that it&#8217;s not cheap, it&#8217;s simply more affordable. It&#8217;s been marketed as the &#8216;$499 table,&#8217; and for the Kickstaters will be true. In my mind it&#8217;s really the &#8216;$814 table&#8217; but I&#8217;ll get into why in the Options section below. Now, let&#8217;s take a closer look at the table.</p>
<div id="attachment_39201" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-39201" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table1-300x157.jpg" alt="10/10 would roll for intitiative" width="300" height="157" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table1-300x157.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table1-298x156.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table1-620x324.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table1.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">10/10 would roll for intitiative</p></div>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Duchess is designed to seat 6 people. It has a felt top and a raised lip to prevent dice or game pieces from rolling of the edge. There will be some assembly required; one of the ways the cost was cut down was by flat-packing the materials for shipping. If the required assembly doesn&#8217;t deter you from looking (I would recommend not getting scared off by that aspect,) then you can think of The Duchess as the standard for what a gaming table needs to be. Plus there&#8217;s a few add-on options that may be worth looking at. This is where the variable cost comes from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Options</h1>
<p>As I mentioned above, the first tier is $549, and it includes the table. Nothing else. Even at this tier you still get to choose the color of finish you want on the table. I can tell you now that if I become a backer, I&#8217;ll be getting the darkest finish, because I&#8217;m a classy broad. You can also add on four retractable cupholders for around $70. These are nice, because it reduces the chances of &#8220;that one friend&#8221; spilling a drink all over your brand new table. If you happen to be that friend in your group this may be a necessity, but for me it just happens to be a nice option. What really gets me excited is the topper you can get for $265. The topper makes it so that you can easily convert your gaming table into a dining table. That&#8217;s why I say this is the&#8217;$814 table&#8221; for me. If I do buy The Duchess, it will be with the topper included. That flexibility is what makes having a gaming table worthwhile in my book. I won&#8217;t fault anyone that decides the topper isn&#8217;t worth their hard-earned money,  but I&#8217;ll never understand the cupholder-only crusaders out there in the world.</p>
<div id="attachment_39203" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-39203 size-medium" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table4-300x169.jpg" alt="Table4" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table4-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table4-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table4-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table4.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A close look at the cupholder</p></div>
<div id="attachment_39204" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-39204" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table2-300x139.jpg" alt="And that topper he won't shut up about" width="300" height="139" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table2-300x139.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table2-298x138.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table2-620x287.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Table2.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">And that topper he won&#8217;t shut up about</p></div>
<h1>Verdict</h1>
<p>This a tough decision! For most of us, it will come down to whether or not we REALLY want a gaming table. If you want the highest end table that money can buy, this may not be worth your time. If you&#8217;re like me and you&#8217;ve been drooling over the table you&#8217;ll never have, it may be time to pull the trigger. BoardGameTables.com has a great track record with quality, and even though there may be another chance like this down the road, it&#8217;s definitely the best price point I&#8217;ve seen to-date.</p>

<p>An unidentified protagonist—let&#8217;s not be too creative and call her Nameless Warrior—is brought into being by a spell. That&#8217;s all we know, and that&#8217;s all the Nameless Warrior knows. Spell=existence. But why? And who are all these people chanting around her? What do they know, and what do they want?</p>
<p>Oh. They want her to go get something that&#8217;s nearly impossible to get, or die trying. Well screw you very much, creepy chanting magicians! Our Nameless Warrior may be magically compelled to obey, but that doesn&#8217;t mean she can&#8217;t walk directly through your bodies to get where she&#8217;s being compelled to go. Just because she doesn&#8217;t know who she is doesn&#8217;t mean she doesn&#8217;t know how to knock a few heads. Capiche?</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-40804" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cold-Forged_Final-440x704-188x300.jpg" alt="Cold-Forged_Final-440x704" width="304" height="485" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cold-Forged_Final-440x704-188x300.jpg 188w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cold-Forged_Final-440x704.jpg 440w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /></p>
<p>Our Nameless Warrior functions by instinct but is driven by ignorance. It&#8217;s her total amnesia, ironically, that makes her so interesting. But not because she&#8217;s ignorant. Far from it. She possesses a number of extremely strong convictions that she expresses swiftly and violently. For one, she doesn&#8217;t like being anyone&#8217;s pawn. For two, she doesn&#8217;t trust anyone, especially not the jerks who summoned her. For three, she <em>hates</em> not knowing, and she blames everyone and everything in proximity. There&#8217;s the implication that it&#8217;s purposeful, or at the very least no one tried to remedy it. One of the Cruais&#8217; people even warns her against learning too much, but this mostly pisses her off. It&#8217;s both satisfying and a great deal of fun to see a character let loose like this, one whose attachments don&#8217;t get in the way of her being stabby.</p>
<p>Not until writing this review did I realize that I&#8217;m usually annoyed by amnesiacs. They&#8217;re a lazy writer&#8217;s crutch and a mediocre writer&#8217;s stumbling block; they cast the vague illusion of mystery but rarely deliver. It&#8217;s easy to identify with a protagonist who, like you (the reader), has no idea what&#8217;s going on, but very, very hard to make the reader identify with the person once their memories have returned, since the circumstances that led to amnesia are often so contrived or far-fetched. (As a side note: if I see one more anime in which the main character is an amnesiac I will probably&#8230;well, okay, I probably won&#8217;t break or set fire to anything, but I probably also won&#8217;t watch it.)</p>
<p>What I appreciate so much here is that the cure isn&#8217;t a bop on the head or a dose of romance or some magic McGuffin. It&#8217;s actually the same process we non-amnesiacs use to find out who we are: trial and error, and the gradual revelations of time. It&#8217;s rather a nice extended metaphor running underneath the narrative. You earn your memories by doing things&#8211;that&#8217;s as true for those of us without magical memory loss as it is for those with it.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more method, without which this story would be a little claustrophobic: the necessity of putting yourself in the context of others. Aadet, a good-humored fellow, also turns out to be wandering the mysterious island, and he more or less bothers her into traveling with him. Their conversations add a new dimension to the story, one that doesn&#8217;t dim the Nameless Warrior&#8217;s intense voice, but does add a bit of complexity to her internal struggle as she tries to understand exactly what she&#8217;s lost along with her memories. Her humanity? Her ability to relate to others? Her ability to be anything more than a tool? All good questions, and all ones she tries to keep behind a stoic (and rather acid) facade.</p>
<p>The end sequence is an even more intensely psychological examination of a very limited (but very high-stakes) set of choices that would feel very dull or confusing in a less competent writer&#8217;s hands. Fortunately, we have Brennan to guide us through both an unfolding mythology and an unfolding set of personal realizations, the capstone to this quest of self-discovery. She manages to set forth the stakes, the negotiation of those stakes, and the resolution all within an internal struggle that, externally, seems only to be a short walk back and forth to the Lhian&#8217;s cauldron. It&#8217;s remarkable to me how a short story can manage to make all of this work on the basis of such brief narrative foundations. But the foundations are sound, and strong, and the Nameless Warrior&#8217;s struggle is very, very real.</p>
<p>The outcome&#8211;which is not cut and dried, and which I probably couldn&#8217;t spoil if I wanted to&#8211;is a tantalizing glimpse at what could be a much, much larger world (and maybe a bit more High Magical than I expected, but that may just be because I read her <em>Natural History</em>, which is, as it says, <em>natural</em> and scientific). I do hope Brennan does more with this world and the characters she&#8217;s placed so deftly within it.</p>
<p><em>Cold-Forged Flame </em>will be released September 13.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DOGS. They&#8217;re alright, aren&#8217;t they? Of course, the Platonic Ideal of a dog is one without all the smells, the watery poops and the chewed-up trainers, and luckily the medium of anime is ready to provide us with a list of canine companions that come close to true perfection.</p>
<p>So while the smiley shiba-inu Maru may have 2.5 million followers on Instagram, we reckon any one of these dogs could give him a run for his money.</p>
<h2>#10 &#8211; Tetsuya 2</h2>
<p><strong>Pomeranian Husky mix from Kuroko no Baske (aka Kuroko&#8217;s Basketball)</strong></p>
<p>Tetsuya Kuroko is a savant basketball player with the special magical power to be utterly unnoticeable. Naturally he needs a little help in the personality department: enter his canine doppelganger Tetsuya #2, who carries around 60% of the weight of the show on his mighty shoulders. Asides from his piercing blue gaze, he has his OWN JERSEY. Now, I&#8217;m normally against animals wearing clothing but damn if Tetsuya 2 doesn&#8217;t pull it off.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-40943 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tetsuya-2.gif" alt="tetsuya 2" width="506" height="320" /></p>
<h2>#9 &#8211; Taromaru</h2>
<p><strong>Shiba Inu from Gakkou Gurashi! (aka School Live!)</strong></p>
<p>Taromaru is a complete troll: he knows how to open doors, steal food and destroy your self-confidence by withholding affection. He also becomes the emotional lynch-pin of the entire series of Gakkou Gurashi, and without spoilers, I can honestly say that your life will never be the same after knowing this little jerk.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-40942 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Taromaru.gif" alt="Taromaru" width="400" height="225" /></p>
<h2>#8 &#8211; Menchi</h2>
<p><strong>Akita Inu from Excel Saga</strong></p>
<p>The name Menchi translates as &#8220;Mincemeat&#8221;, which explains this poor girl&#8217;s dissatisfaction with living as Excel&#8217;s pet. Being labelled as the emergency ration can&#8217;t do much for your nerves, but at least poor Menchi gets to vent her feelings at the end of every episode of Excel Saga, howling over the end credits.</p>
<div class="video"><iframe width="620" height="465" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61GFr8fVs6g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<h2>#7 &#8211; Blue</h2>
<p><strong>Wolfdog from Wolf&#8217;s Rain</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never seen Wolf&#8217;s Rain, I highly recommend it. It&#8217;s from the same team as Cowboy Bebop and this follow-up series has the same quality of stellar character design. Blue had one of the best plotlines and character developments in Wolf&#8217;s Rain, being the devoted companion to a jaded alcoholic hunter, and ending up finding her inner wolf. It just so happens her inner wolf is a rather attractive young lady. It&#8217;s like they were preempting my fan fiction.</p>
<p>YOU&#8217;RE MY GIRL, BLUE.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-40932 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Blue.gif" alt="Blue" width="500" height="325" /></p>
<h2>#6 &#8211; Jeff</h2>
<p><strong>St. Bernard from Kiki&#8217;s Delivery Service</strong></p>
<p>Jeff is SUCH A GOOD BOY. Despite having a brief appearance in a film dominated by a smart-talking cat, Jeff effortlessly steals his scenes, saving Kiki and Jiji&#8217;s bacon on their first disastrous delivery job. He even knows how to shut the front door behind him, showing that he&#8217;s probably the smartest dog on this list, despite the absence of language or underpants.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-40938 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jeff.gif" alt="Jeff" width="500" height="261" /></p>
<h2>#5 &#8211; Buddy</h2>
<p><strong>Akita Inu from Nichijou</strong></p>
<p>Buddy is the star of a few throwaway skits within the great comedy show Nichijou. He makes it on to this list by being complete unassuming, and contributing to anime history with the infamous &#8220;dog sympathy&#8221; maneuver. Can you imagine being at such a low point in your life that a dog, unprompted, shows you sympathy? Buddy may not be the cutest pupper on the list, but his knowing gaze and gentle paw earn him a spot in the pantheon of doggies.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-40933 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Buddy.gif" alt="Buddy" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<h2>#4 &#8211; Ein</h2>
<p><strong>Pembroke Welsh Corgi from Cowboy Bebop</strong></p>
<p>What list of anime dogs would be complete without the genius &#8220;data-dog&#8221; from Cowboy Bebop? Ein perfectly checkmates the distant cynicism of Spike and brings a sense of whimsy to the team of the Bebop, and quickly learns how to eat dog food in zero gravity. Highly smart, highly valuable and highly cute, Ein was at his best in the episode Mushroom Hunting, which gave us one of the greatest gifs of all time after Ed fed him hallucinogenic fungi.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-40934 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ein-2.gif" alt="Ein 2" width="371" height="281" /></p>
<h2>#3 &#8211; Koromaru</h2>
<p><strong>Shiba Inu from Persona 3</strong></p>
<p>Koromaru is definitely the star of both the Persona 3 game, as well as the 4 recent film adaptations. A scrappy little Shiba Inu, he loyally defends his master&#8217;s shrine after his passing, before gaining magical powers that allow him to murder the manifestations of Freudian repression. Armed with a goddamn combat knife in the mouth, Koromaru astounds his enemies with his stylish wing accoutrements on his jersey. You know, right before he stabs them to death.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-40939 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Koromaru-2.gif" alt="Koromaru 2" width="500" height="255" /></p>
<h2>#2 &#8211; Inuyasha</h2>
<p><strong>Demon Dog Spirit Thing from InuYasha</strong></p>
<p>This counts right? Like all good puppers, Inuyasha starts out as a total bastard that learns the value of not being a total bastard. Luckily for the ordinary school girl Kagome, he&#8217;s easily trained with some magic beads, which cause him to obey her command of &#8220;sit!&#8221;. Makes total sense that they get married.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-40936 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Inuyasha-2.gif" alt="Inuyasha 2" width="500" height="304" /></p>
<h2>#1 &#8211; Apo</h2>
<p><strong>Pug puppy from Space Brothers</strong></p>
<p>Apo, short for Apollo, is small and sweet and the greatest goddamn fictional dog that has ever existed. That&#8217;s right, Call of Duty Dog, get the hell out of my house. With a stylish yet subtle heart marking on his shoulder, Apo wins the hearts of all those around him as he runs around NASA headquarters smiling like a goon. If the brilliant characters and awesome science of Space Brothers doesn&#8217;t convince you to watch that show, I certainly hope one amazing pug puppy can sway you.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-40931 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Apo-2.gif" alt="Apo 2" width="500" height="280" /></p>
<p>Oh you sexy beast.</p>
<p>Obviously this is far from a comprehensive list &#8211; we didn&#8217;t even get to marvel at Black Hayate from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood! Let us know in the comments what your favourite anime dogs are.</p>
<p>Anime puppers make a frequent  appearance over on Geekly Inc&#8217;s anime podcast Transformation Sequence! Come listen!</p>

<h5>Synopsis from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Drunks_and_Dragons_Episodes">Drunks and Dragons Wiki</a>:</h5>
<blockquote><p>Bewildered by their most recent very near death experience, the party confronts <a title="Ros" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Ros">Ros</a> about her seemingly newfound powers. She reveals that she used to work as an assassin, but decided to become a<a title="Simple boatman" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Simple_boatman">simple boatwoman</a> after she found she enjoyed killing too much. Thom is understandably confused and aroused. <a class="mw-redirect" title="Lord Titus Harper" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lord_Titus_Harper">Harper</a> shows Ros his secret for dealing with a <a title="Harper's Dark Past" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Harper%27s_Dark_Past">dark past</a> and gives her a pill of basilisk dung to eat. As Ros starts to trip balls they head to a nice inn for some wining, dining and burpees.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31792" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/logo-1.jpg" alt="logo-1" width="337" height="145" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/logo-1.jpg 337w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/logo-1-300x129.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/logo-1-298x128.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" />At Gen Con 2016, I had the opportunity to talk to Benjamin Loomes about Syrinscape, the program that creates unique background sounds for GMs to up the immersion of their games using an expansive library of sounds for many settings.</p>
<p>GI: For those who don&#8217;t know about Syrinscape, what is it and how does it work?</p>
<p>BL: Excellent, Syrinscape is an app on iPhones and iPads and Android Phones and Tabs and PC and Macs, that makes beautiful, immersive background sounds for tabletop roleplaying games and also board games now. So rather than just putting on a 15 minute loop recording of a medieval town, it&#8217;s actually an app that creates the entire medieval town with seamless endless action. So random carts might come past, a hawker might call out now and then, a bard might play a song. If you don&#8217;t like the bard playing the song you just switch off the bard and he doesn&#8217;t sing the song. If you want some rain you can pop over the the storm sound set and turn on some rain to mix that in. Then when you&#8217;re ready for the dragon to attack, you just go “Red Dragon City Raid” and go “Pop” and just suddenly it explodes into flame and high energy music starts. It&#8217;s really really easy to use, takes hardly any attention for the GM to run, but creates incredibly realistic and beautiful background noise.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>Now you can pull up the creator, use all the sounds: the fantasy sounds, the Sci-Fi sounds, the board game sounds and mix them all together however you like.</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>GI: We talked to you about it at GenCon last year, and you mentioned you&#8217;re doing board game sounds as well now, so what has changed for Syrinscape in the last year?</p>
<p>BL: Two major things: number one is the board game player so we have a license with Catan with official sounds of Catan. So the next time you play Catan you start the game and you&#8217;re immersed in the beautiful island of Catan with chirping birdies and sheep baaing and everything.</p>
<p>And then when you roll a seven, unlike before, there&#8217;s now a Robber one shot trigger roll sound so you just touch the Robber and there&#8217;s 60 different smartass comments from the Robber. So you can really really mock your fellow players when you get that number seven. So seven now is a real event.</p>
<p>I have a license now with Boss Monster, which is a fantastic sort of 8 bit, grungy card game. Also Blind Ferret&#8217;s Orphans and Ashes, RnR&#8217;s Spellcaster, and more and more board games so that&#8217;s really cool.</p>
<p>And then we&#8217;re also releasing, going live this weekend, is the Syrinscape Sound Set creator. Which is really huge because people for ages have been asking, “Can we pull in our own sounds?” and yes now you can, now you can pull up the creator, use all the sounds: the fantasy sounds, the Sci-Fi sounds, the board game sounds and mix them all together however you like. Then grab your Neverwinter Nights soundtrack and pull in that music, and do some sound like the evil speech you&#8217;ve got ready for your game. It uploads to the server and becomes a sound set that you have access to across all the devices I mentioned before.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>One of the really important things in Syrinscape is getting enough variability in the source sounds.</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>GI: So most of what we do at Geekly Inc is focused around podcasting and often we have people who are playing games online instead together in a room. How could Syrinscape help people get immersed into an environment and stay in the game, when they&#8217;re not in the same room?</p>
<p>BL: Yeah, really really important. It&#8217;s got really fantastic integration with D20 Pro, with Fantasy Grounds, and with Realmworks where you can actually trigger Syrinscape from within the app. Either on the players remote machines so you can actually set off a certain location like I was saying a Red Dragon or a medieval town, or if you want to cast a spell and hit the fireball one shot. Suddenly on their machines everything&#8217;s going to be exploding and blowing up and screaming. Or with other virtual tabletops you can actually route the audio of Syrinscape through whatever Teamspeak or Skype you use. And that&#8217;s working really really well as well.</p>
<p>GI: Could DM&#8217;s theoretically send a sound to one party member but not the others?</p>
<p>BL: You can&#8217;t do that yet, that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re headed. So we have our souped up version of Syrinscape next year where you&#8217;ll be able to have a Master/Minion setup so all the players will have little Minion players and the GM will have control so they can set off some sounds. Or the players on their little minions can set off some of their characters spells and that gets broadcast off to the rest of the table. Which is really cool.</p>
<p>GI: Do you have a white whale of sounds? Something that you&#8217;d love to get but just can&#8217;t? Too difficult or haven&#8217;t found a way yet?</p>
<p>BL: Ah, is there a sound that we can&#8217;t get? We made airstrike sounds, and in the end we made that from me swooshing a stick past a microphone and me banging my hand on the desk and having the ruler of the edge of the desk going dgadgadgadga so there&#8217;s this swoosh, dunk, dgadgadgadga. And I&#8217;ve hunted Youtube for videos on foley, which are all the geniuses who create sounds. So my armor foley in Syrinscape is literally my laptop bag and by shaking it, you get the rubbing of the fabrics through the laptop and the jangling of the little zippers and things. It&#8217;s weird stuff like the fact that punches don&#8217;t sound anything like punches? So you have to go with the cinematic concept of punch which is that whoosh and then the big meaty clunk, while a normal punch just is pretty much almost silent.</p>
<p>But something we can&#8217;t do? Well we just find the solution. And of course with our license with Paizo we&#8217;re forever making monsters that no ones ever heard in their entire life so we&#8217;re making decisions about what these monsters sound like and how to voice them. Which is super cool.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>There&#8217;s some really amazing examples, I spent like an afternoon editing vomits the other day. Which was amazing&#8230;</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>GI: Followup question, you are dealing with a lot of things that don&#8217;t exist in the real world or that you can&#8217;t actually get a microphone up to an airstrike. So what&#8217;s the weirdest thing you ever mushed together to make a sound? Or something that people might find interesting to know, “Oh that&#8217;s actually such and such?”</p>
<p>BL: Yeah there&#8217;s some really amazing examples, I spent like an afternoon editing vomits the other day. Which was amazing amd ended up with real rich sounds that I got from freesound.org which is this fantastic collaborative community where people share sounds with each other. It&#8217;s amazing. So I got the sounds of someone retching. And then the vomit splashing on the floor was just pouring a jug of water into another jug which sounds seriously gross and very, very nauseauting.</p>
<p>And the Red Dragon, if people want to listen go to the Red Dragon City Raid, and you can hear my voice, so you can report how high and lovely and light and not very manly it is. And then listen to the roars in the Red Dragon either in the video demo or if you download it, and it sounds epicly huge and fantasticly impressive. So I basically recorded like a “Raaahhhhh” with a bit of throat in it and everything, and then the wonder of pitch shifting and stretching and all this sort of amazing stuff makes this incredibly massive, meaty sounding beast. So that&#8217;s really fun.</p>
<p>GI: Okay, so basically don&#8217;t come by your house at Halloween because you&#8217;ll just have the most terrifying soundtrack?</p>
<p>BL: Oh yeah, we actually totally did that last Halloween yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>With our license with Paizo we&#8217;re forever making monsters that no ones ever heard in their entire life&#8230;</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>GI: I just got back from living in Australia, and since you&#8217;re from there I wanted to ask you: what do you maybe find different about the gaming scene there versus here?</p>
<p>BL: Yeah. Here it&#8217;s huge. You know, there&#8217;s a lot of people into it. There&#8217;s a really diverse crowd, even the difference in Gen Con over the last three or four years, the number of women, the acceptance and openness in the styles of what you can be here at Gen Con is really big. And I don&#8217;t think Australia has matured to that degree yet. PAX Aus is making a big difference but it&#8217;s still brand new. So yeah it&#8217;s really a wonderful community here in America of amazingly creative and accepting and beautiful people. I think that&#8217;s really great. I mean there&#8217;s big cultural differences between America and Australia, Australia has the whole Tall Poppy Syndrome where you don&#8217;t want to stand out or think you&#8217;re better. Whereas America is totally able to rejoice in people&#8217;s successes and really enthused in an unashamed way which is a great thing about Americans.</p>
<p>GI: On that note, is there something that you think people in North America are missing out on that&#8217;s happening over there? Or are there any weird hidden secrets that people don&#8217;t know about.</p>
<p>BL: (laughs) Ah man, I mean the main thing is if you&#8217;re North American the main thing you&#8217;re missing out on is Sydney&#8217;s beaches. Amazing boogie boarding and beach environments. Australians obviously have this wonderful, self deprecating, sarcastic humour which is really really strong. But I find people say Americans don&#8217;t take sarcasm, but that&#8217;s just not true, amongst gaming crowds. And people say Americans don&#8217;t know there&#8217;s other countries in the world but amongst the gaming crowds that&#8217;s just not true.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>But something we can&#8217;t do? Well we just find the solution.</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>GI: Right. I imagine a lot of it has to do with the fact that we&#8217;re all imagining a thousand fantasy worlds in our head, so it&#8217;s not hard to remember that Canada exists?</p>
<p>BL: Yeah exactly yeah. I think  it&#8217;s a matter of creative gaming and that social aspect of connecting people across the world that&#8217;s really incredible and amazing and effective at enlightening you, making you more accepting. Helping you to be sympathetic to other points of view and getting a lot out of life.</p>
<p>GI: You guys are recording sounds here at Gen Con, so what kinds of things are you getting from people?</p>
<p>BL: So last year we got a license to produce the official Gen Con soundset so people can now go to Gen Con within Syrinscape and they can walk around the exhibit hall and hear the general hub a bub. And they can hear hawkers calling out selling things, kids whinging for ice creams, people talking about their characters. And then you touch the Dragon Raid and the official GenCon Dragon comes in and roars and nerds run away going “Please don&#8217;t eat me!” and that&#8217;s been amazing and people really got into donating samples. We got something like a thousand samples, six hundred of which we used.</p>
<p>So this year I&#8217;m collecting demon voices and devil voices, humans, heroes, and roars and monsters and things. To do the last chapter of Hell&#8217;s Revels for the Paizo Pathfinder game, and that&#8217;s going to be really really great.</p>
<p>And you know, one of the really important things in Syrinscape is getting enough variability in the source sounds. You know, no matter how much I mention dragons and processing if you&#8217;re always going from a smallish group of voice actors you&#8217;re going to run out of variability. So I&#8217;ve got guys who&#8217;ve given sound here and I&#8217;ve loved it and contacted them and asked them to give more stuff. A guy named Morgan Rand who donated a voice at PaizoCon a couple years ago and is now the big bag in Hell&#8217;s Revels and has kind of become semi famous for being absolutely awesome. And he does this sort of Professor Snape, sarcastic slow voice thing and he&#8217;s been fantastic. And I could never produce a voice like him, his voice is luscious and deep and big and gorgeous.</p>
<p>GI: Okay well thank you so much Benjamin and best of luck at Gen Con!</p>
<p>BL: Thanks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Comic Book Day was only a few days ago, that means it’s time to check out some of the highlights from the last few weeks. The very cool, very strange, <em>Bounty </em>from Dark Horse kicked off these past few weeks and a few DC Rebirth titles have really caught our eye too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40772" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Highlights-1200x848.jpg" alt="Highlights" width="1000" height="707" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Highlights-1200x848.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Highlights-300x212.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Highlights-768x543.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Highlights-298x211.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Highlights-620x438.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2><strong><em><u>Bounty #1 (And #2 Sort Of)</u></em></strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_40761" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-40761" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bounty-1-789x1200.jpg" alt="Bounty #1- Dark Horse" width="620" height="943" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bounty-1-789x1200.jpg 789w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bounty-1-197x300.jpg 197w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bounty-1-768x1167.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bounty-1-298x453.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bounty-1-620x942.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bounty-1.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Bounty #1- Dark Horse</p></div>
<h3>Kurtis J. Wiebe<br />
Mindy Lee</h3>
<p>Bounty is the kind of comic I wasn’t actually aware I needed in my life until now. Results were always going to be pretty good considering that Kurtis Wiebe is behind the phenomenal <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/tag/rat-queens/"><em>Rat Queens</em></a>, a fantasy/comedy adventure with an all-female lead ensemble. So now we’re here with <em>Bounty</em>, the next logical step. A sci-fi/comedy adventure with an <em>almost</em> all-female lead ensemble. It tells the story of Nina and Georgie, two very tough anti-corporate bounty hunters forced to go on the run and erase their own identities after a job gone sour. I’ve grabbed the first couple issues and I have to say, I’m pretty much hooked. It has a great, pulpy vibe and a real twisted sci-fi quality to it. Wiebe, much like in <em>Rat Queens</em>, isn’t afraid to embrace the tropes of his chosen genre. There’s exo-suits, space-ships, drones, lasers, and even futuristic gangs with one too many cybernetic implants.</p>
<div id="attachment_40762" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-40762 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bounty-Extract.jpg" alt="Just a brief taste of the action." width="600" height="862" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bounty-Extract.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bounty-Extract-209x300.jpg 209w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bounty-Extract-298x428.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Just a brief taste of the action.</p></div>
<p>It’s excellent, action packed stuff and the characters are all truly excellent. <em>Rat Queens </em>was full of strong, well-written female characters and <em>Bounty </em>is no different. Readers hoping for something similar, but different, to <em>Rat Queens </em>will be in luck. My only real gripe is that across these two issues, there is a real effort on Wiebe’s part to develop our heroes’ backstories and still keep the main story chugging along and I can’t help but think that he just doesn’t have enough pages to really do what he wants. If you’re in the market for a rollicking, sci-fi adventure set in a very interesting world with a distinct <em>Saga</em>-esque flavour, <em>Bounty </em>may be just the ticket.</p>
<h2><strong><em><u>Aquaman #5</u></em></strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_40763" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-40763" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aquaman-5-780x1200.jpg" alt="Aquaman #5- DC Comics" width="620" height="954" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aquaman-5-780x1200.jpg 780w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aquaman-5-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aquaman-5-768x1181.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aquaman-5-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aquaman-5-620x953.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aquaman-5.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Aquaman #5- DC Comics</p></div>
<h3>Dan Abnett<br />
Phillipe Briones</h3>
<p>I’ve made no real secret of my love for <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/tag/aquaman/"><em>Aquaman</em></a> since it came out, boring every comics reader I know to tears with exclamations about how good it is. But guys, it seriously is. The Drowning is a truly, truly excellent Aquaman story and every single issue has been top stuff. This one is no exception. After Mera’s questionable actions last issue, they find themselves on the run. While the issue does essentially play out like one big action scene/chase and it does (I will admit) drag slightly in places, it’s still incredibly excellent. I not only like, but actively admire Abnett’s interpretation of Aquaman. He’s principled almost to a fault and the worse things get for him, the more I want to see him succeed.</p>
<p>In this issue we’re treated to Aquaman as a peerless warrior, but one that still is fully aware of the consequences of his actions and I seriously love it. I want to keep reading just so I can finally see him win. My favorite part of this issue is Aquaman’s closest ally, Mera. Their relationship is just handled so well this issue. It would have been easy for Abnett to fall into endless bickering and sniping, but instead he treats the couple (the Aquamans?) like real people. Mera has made a mistake, but Aquaman is willing to forgive her and even understands <em>why </em>she did what she did; it’s refreshing to see a relationship in comic books handled so well and it’s almost a reason that I keep reading. With some big rumblings in the background and an intriguing vision of Atlantean society and politics, I highly recommend grabbing the back issues of this, or even placing your trade pre-order now.</p>
<h2><strong><em><u>Wonder Woman #4 (Year One Part 2)</u></em></strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_40765" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-40765 size-large" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WW4-1-780x1200.jpg" alt="WW4" width="620" height="954" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WW4-1-780x1200.jpg 780w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WW4-1-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WW4-1-768x1182.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WW4-1-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WW4-1-620x954.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WW4-1.jpg 832w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wonder Woman #4- DC Comics</p></div>
<h3>Greg Rucka<br />
Nicola Scott</h3>
<p>Let me just get this out of the way right now. I have not read a better comic in the last month. Perhaps the last 2 months. <em>Wonder Woman #4 </em>was just fantastic. I’m calling it now; <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/tag/wonder-woman/"><em>Wonder Woman: Year One</em></a> will, if Greg Rucka keeps it up, go down as one of the best Wonder Woman stories in the last 5 years. This issue opens just after Steve Trevor and Co have crashed on Themyscira and a hearty debate is held as to what is to be done about the sole survivor and the possible threat that Ares has returned. Rucka’s writing is just so smooth that even a council debate is a treat, its essentially exposition, but it’s very well done exposition. The story goes along at a fair pace and by the end a fair bit has happened, but it never feels rushed as Rucka spends just enough time in each piece to do them justice. The highlight of the issue is Diana and her mother’s relationship. There’s no deep trauma or extensive back-story to it, just a well written, well-drawn mother and daughter. And when Wonder Woman finally becomes Wonder Woman and takes the step to leave Themyscria, there’s some real emotion to it.</p>
<div id="attachment_40769" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-40769" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WW-Extract-3-1200x929.jpg" alt="Nicola Scott in full force." width="620" height="480" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WW-Extract-3-1200x929.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WW-Extract-3-300x232.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WW-Extract-3-768x595.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WW-Extract-3-298x231.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WW-Extract-3-620x480.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Nicola Scott in full force.</p></div>
<p>The entire issue is also fantastically drawn, colored and inked and for the first time in I don’t know how long I actually enjoy just having a read through for the pictures. With Rucka’s separate storylines only really just picking up steam now, you owe it to yourself to go and grab the back-issues of this and get on board with one of the year’s best comics.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40776" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Honourable-Mentions-1.jpg" alt="Honourable Mentions" width="3508" height="2480" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Honourable-Mentions-1.jpg 3508w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Honourable-Mentions-1-300x212.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Honourable-Mentions-1-768x543.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Honourable-Mentions-1-1200x848.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Honourable-Mentions-1-298x211.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Honourable-Mentions-1-620x438.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 3508px) 100vw, 3508px" /></p>
<p>There was more out recently than just <em>Aquman </em>and <em>Wonder Woman </em>though (much to my disappointment, I feel that all titles should be replaced with just those ones) and perhaps chief among those is the latest in Tom King’s <em><a href="http://geeklyinc.com/tag/batman/">Batman</a>, Batman #5</em>. Tom King seems to finally wrapped up his Gotham and Gotham-Girl arc in a suitably dark, <em>Batman </em>style. While I’m not 100% keen on what he seems to have planned next with the Death of Batman (again) and it didn’t really feel like a Batman story, it was still a solid read and a good start to King’s run on such a big series.</p>
<p>Jeff Lemire’s <em><a href="http://geeklyinc.com/tag/moon-knight/">Moon Knight</a> </em>has also wrapped up it’s first arc with <em>Moon Knight #5</em>. With such a trippy beginning, I was expecting something odd, and that was indeed what was delivered. More pyramids, more identity crises and a particularly cool sequence of changing artists make this a top issue and a great finish for the arc. It’s sadly let down by a weak last couple of pages that, considering the previous 4 issues, seems like a cop-out. But, I’m nevertheless still excited for the promised <em>Moon Knight #6</em>.</p>
<p>Speaking of weird, <em>Paper Girls #8 </em>from <em>Saga</em> writer Brian K. Vaughn has also warped onto shelves recently. A highly enjoyable sci-fi bag of weirdness, <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/tag/paper-girls/"><em>Paper Girls</em></a> has yet to disappoint and this issue is no exception. Monsters, time-travel, ruminations on destiny and time and of course cryptic messages are all par for the course and this issue has those in spades. With a huge number of threads quickly coming to a head and head-scratching reaching incredible heights, <em>Paper Girls #9</em> can’t come soon enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you approach the mysterious house on the outskirts of town, the sky seems to get darker and more foreboding. With every step closer to the front door, your heart beats and your legs feel heavier and heavier until you have to force yourself up the steps. As the door creaks open, you peer inside, scanning the room before stepping into the foyer. Fully inside the house, you and your friends start looking around when you hear the worst sound-the door slams shut and the lock turns. You are now trapped inside the <em>Stargazer’s Manor</em> and have to <em>Escape the Room</em>. </span></p>

<p>During Gen Con this year, Brad Brockway and I were able to talk with Kacey Templin from ThinkFun about their <em>Escape the Room</em> game <em>Mystery at the Stargazer’s Manor,</em> and learned some information about their newest escape game: <em>Secret of Dr. Gravely’s Retreat</em>. Kacey explained to us that ThinkFun&#8217;s “Escape the Room” is an escape room in a box. Everything you need to play comes with the game, and you don’t have destroy anything in the room or location. This means that you can repackage it all for later play as a host. <em>Stargazer&#8217;s Manor</em> takes place in the Victorian Era and has elements of a steampunk throughout its theme. The players used to work for Stargazer in his manor until tragedy strikes, and Stargazer goes crazy and throws everyone out of the house. Some time later it is realized that no one has seen Stargazer, but that things are starting to happen in his house. Lights and sounds have been noticed coming from the house, so the players decide to go in and check out what is going on in the manor. Once inside, the players are then trapped in the manor and have an hour and a half to escape. The game provides a series of envelopes, puzzles, and a solution wheel to escape. The first card given sets up the initial experience and then there are a few hints are given to begin the game.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40666" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DR-GRAVELY.jpg" alt="DR GRAVELY" width="450" height="400" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DR-GRAVELY.jpg 450w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DR-GRAVELY-300x267.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DR-GRAVELY-298x265.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>The second version of the game is “Secret of Dr. Gravely’s Retreat”, following the mystery of Dr. Gravely where all is not as it seems. As the lucky recipient of a trip to Dr. Gravely’s retreat, you are  expecting to live in the lap of luxury, experiencing high class spa and relaxation treatments. Upon your arrival though, you are quick to discover that there is a dark mystery surrounding the area, leaving you with an hour and half to try and escape the truth of what is happening at the retreat.</p>
<p>The game is meant to be set up in an individual’s home, or preferred location, where the envelopes and hints can be placed around the room. As each envelope is completed, there will be a link to the next clue, until eventually all clues are finished. The guests participants are then given the time , to attempt going through the hints and in connection with the solution wheel, solve the mystery of the house. <em>Stargazer Manor</em> is family friendly starting at ages 10+ and for groups of 3-8. Due to the darker nature of the game, <em>Secret of Dr. Gravely’s Retreat</em> is still family friendly, but starts at ages 13 and up, and still good for groups of 3-8.  It is suggested that if the game is being played by just adults, that 5 players is best way to balance the experience without taking away from the complexity of the clues.</p>
<p>ThinkFun has also provided on their <a href="http://www.thinkfun.com/products/type/escape-games/" target="_blank">website </a>a list of items that can be used to enhance the experience of the players including additional hints, music playlists, and costume recommendations. Both of the “Escape the Room” games are available to play without a host or game-master, leaving everyone with the capability to play, or they can be played with a host. While the secrets are all revealed during the first time the game is played, playing with other groups and using a host, does increase the play-ability of the game.</p>
<p>Brad and I also had the opportunity to run through a little section of the mini-escape the room setup that ThinkFun hosted at GenCon. Inside our draped off booth, we were greeted with an image of a staircase, broken and falling into itself in places, with several glyphs on the individual stairs. We took our solution wheel, examined the stairs and worked to try and figure out the riddle presented to us. After a few mishaps, we finally figured the solution and found our resolution. The puzzle was complex without being overly difficult and provided enough of a challenge that once it was resolved, a sense of accomplishment was felt. Just being able to complete a small part of the puzzle, made me want to try out more.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, I loved the idea of having an escape room that you can set up in your own home/location of choice and play with friends and family. While the games lose some of their mystery after the first play through, the price for the game is very reasonable compared to going to an actual escape room or doing something similar like a murder mystery games. The idea and theme of both games have been fully flushed out by the creators and the options provided by ThinkFun on their <a href="http://www.thinkfun.com/products/type/escape-games/" target="_blank">website </a>(music, costumes, etc.), help to provide an overall fun and immersive experience. Both games are available for purchase at Target or on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Escape-Room-Stargazers-Manor-Board/dp/B01BX4G62W?tag=gkly-20">Amazon</a></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>With Geekly Redux, we revisit our childhood favorites and determine whether or </em><em>not they hold up.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40708 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Skeletor-He-Man.jpg" alt="Skeletor He-Man" width="1179" height="882" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Skeletor-He-Man.jpg 1179w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Skeletor-He-Man-300x224.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Skeletor-He-Man-768x575.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Skeletor-He-Man-298x223.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Skeletor-He-Man-620x464.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1179px) 100vw, 1179px" /></p>
<p>I was born in the very early 1980s. It was a fantastic time to grow up -Reagan was in the Oval Office, we had the NES, two Star Wars movies, and Thriller was on the radio. The cartoon game was on point at the time. We had G.I.Joe, Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Rainbow Brite (I liked it, what about it?), and many more shows. Unlike anything that came before it, every cartoon was attached to a massive toy line. All my favorite shows had figures I could play with and create my own adventures at home.</p>
<p>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe ran from October 1983 to November 1985 with a whopping 130 episodes. There was also a spin-off series, two made-for-TV movies, Secret of the Sword and The He-Man/She-Ra Christmas Special, and even a live action movie in 1987, starring Dolph Lundgren (Frank Langella’s Skeletor was awesome, by the way). A reboot/sequel series titled The New Adventures of He-Man aired in 1990 and a full on reboot of the series by Mike Young Productions aired in 2002. He-Man also has the distinction of being the first syndicated show based on a toy line and, within its first year, was seen on TV in over 30 countries. Needless to say, He-Man was a cultural phenomenon and it was HUGE in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Like many shows of the time, there was a strong presence of Good vs Evil in well-defined sides, although this is likely a byproduct of the Reagan-era US=Good/Communism=Bad. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe is the story of a young man (Good :D) who can transform to an identical man, only tanned and wearing less clothes while fighting against the the forces of evil led by Skeletor (Bad &gt;:( ), the skull-faced sorcerer.</p>
<p>My dad was a member of the United States Air Force and we were stationed in Japan, where I was born. When He-Man started airing in Japan, my parents recorded every episode they could on our giant Beta-Max player (a precursor to the VCRs, for you kids that are too young to remember). As a baby barbarian, this was my favorite show. My brother and I repeatedly watched every episode.</p>
<p>I looked up to this golden mountain of man muscles as a shining example of what a powerful fur-underwear wearing hero should strive to be. He was right and just and helped those in need. Every episode ended with a PSA that taught children about inappropriate touching, don&#8217;t do drugs, and helping others. Every lesson reiterated the moral of the story we just watched.</p>
<p>I loved the art, the fantastical world shown with a mix of technology and magic. Everything seemed epic and grand. I can still hear the trumpets of the theme song in my head. I loved this show and idolized He-Man; I even dressed up as He-Man for Halloween in the second grade. Pretty embarrassing thinking about a skinny little Asian kid pretending to be a built blond barbarian.</p>
<p>Fast forward nearly three decades. I bought the DVDs of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe a while back but haven’t had the time to just sit and enjoy this old classic. Now that I have a baby barbarian of my own, I decided to put my son on my lap and share with him the show I loved when I was his age.</p>
<div class="video"><iframe width="620" height="465" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7yeA7a0uS3A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><strong>So, does it hold up?</strong></p>
<p>No. Not at all.</p>
<p>The show’s opening tells you everything you need to know about the characters. Prince Adam, was given the Sword of Power by the Sorceress that could transform him into He-Man, the Most Powerful Man in the Universe and his talking green tiger companion, Cringer, into Battle Cat, the Most Powerful Cat in the Universe. Together they team up with Man-at-Arms, his daughter Teela and a few other “Masters” like Ram-Man, Roboto, the space cop, Zodak. They fight against the boneheaded Skeletor and his minions: Evil-lyn, Trapjaw, Beastman and Merman.</p>
<p>I remembered this show being amazing. It was a tent pole of my childhood. It taught me things and shaped who I was. My first Dungeons &amp; Dragons character was a Lawful Good Barbarian because of He-Man! As I watched it, I realized that this was shit. It was utter shit. There was He-Man, there was Skeletor…there was Orko…ugh…there was Santa Claus? Why the hell was Santa Claus in a He-Man cartoon? They celebrated Christmas on Eternia? What the fuck.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40709 " src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Santa-He-Man-221x300.png" alt="Santa He-Man" width="462" height="627" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Santa-He-Man-221x300.png 221w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Santa-He-Man-298x404.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Santa-He-Man.png 419w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>
<p>The show was not anywhere near as good as I remembered and my nostalgia for the property was better than the show itself. It was horribly animated &#8211; the animation was so extremely repetitive that you could make a drinking game out of it. I do understand that this was an effective cost cutting measure, but it became hugely distracting.</p>
<p>The show was also horribly written, which is insane to me because many of the episodes were written by Paul Dini who created Harley Quinn for Batman: The Animated Series and J. Michael Straczynski who created Babylon 5. Sometimes the adventures make no sense. In the episode “Day of the Machines”, Prince Adam turns into He-Man to get rid of a computer virus. He-Man even asks “How do we get inside the computer to fight it?”. I don’t know He-Man, maybe download up-to-date anti-virus software? Call the Geek Squad?</p>
<p>I couldn’t finish the series. I got through the first disc. You’d think this show was made for children! I put the DVDs back on the shelf and I wept and after a few short therapy sessions, I moved on.</p>
<p><strong>Did your son like it?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, but he’s a dumb baby. What does he know about good cartoons?</p>
<p><strong>Is there any hope for the He-Man Franchise?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40710 " src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2002-He-Man.jpg" alt="2002 He-Man" width="819" height="614" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2002-He-Man.jpg 500w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2002-He-Man-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2002-He-Man-298x224.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></p>
<p>In 2002, there was a new He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon series by Mike Young Productions and designs by The Four Horsemen, a talented group of toy designers. This show aired on Cartoon Network while I was too busy being a cool and hip early 20-something year old adventurer.</p>
<p>I recognized some of the voice actors: Cam Clarke, who previously played the original Leonardo from the 1987 iteration of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Kaneda from AKIRA, played He-Man/Prince Adam while Garry Chalk, who you may remember as Optimus Primal from the excellent Transformers: Beast Wars and Beast Machines, played Teela’s father, Man-at-Arms. The talent behind this show was top notch.</p>
<p>While this show was very obviously still designed to sell toys, one thing Mike Young Productions did differently was that they told an amazing story. He-Man was no longer just a tanned, naked Prince Adam, he physically looked different and was someone who wasn’t sure he could live up to being He-Man. Skeletor was kinda scary now and a bit psychotic instead of a bumbling foil for our hero. Evil-lyn had daddy issues (her dad is called the Faceless One. He’s a badass). Characters had motivations and growth. Sometimes the good guys did not so good things to get ahead. This is the show my rose-tinted nostalgia remembered from my childhood. I believe that it is an extremely underrated show. If you hadn’t seen it before and liked He-Man growing up, look for this on DVD. It’s well worth a watch.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found this letter to the editor from an <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/02/27/389589676/leonard-nimoys-advice-to-a-biracial-girl-in-1968">NPR story</a>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether you read the NPR story or not, the correspondence is a must read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought about this exchange constantly when watching this episode. The heartbreaking hopeless resignation of the young viewer breaks my heart every time I read it. I appreciate that Leonard Nimoy spoke to her at great length, devoting the entirety of his part of the article to her &#8211; to let her know that he knows she will be loved and accepted for who she is and to encourage her to have courage to be herself. Its also worth noting how much he appreciates that people can be terribly cruel and that it will be hard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Yesteryear</em> is a direct sequel to an episode of <em>Star Trek</em> called <em>The City on the Edge of Forever</em>. <em>The City on the Edge of Forever</em> is one of those seminal pieces of science fiction that plays over and over again in my imagination. It has done so since I was very little and will be one of the last things rattling around in that head of mine when I go. Its really good. It was showered in critical acclaim winning the 1968 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hugo Award</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Dramatic Presentation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When I’ve had friends who know I love Trek but have never seen an episode of Original Series ask me what one episode they should watch if they just watch one I send them here to <em>The City on the Edge of Forever</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you are reading this review and have not seen that episode, my advice to you is that you watch it. Don’t worry&#8211;I’ll wait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back! I hope you enjoyed having your mind blown. Now to the episode at hand, <em>Yesteryear</em>. We begin in stardate 5373.4 around one of the more iconic planets in <em>Star Trek</em> where the Time Vortex and its guardian live.</span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-40575 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Guardian-of-Forever-300x223.jpg" alt="Guardian of Forever" width="738" height="549" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Guardian-of-Forever-300x223.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Guardian-of-Forever-298x221.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Guardian-of-Forever-620x460.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Guardian-of-Forever.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we have a team of historians who are conducting a complete review of all of history (!!!) and have decided they just aren’t cool enough to travel through time without Marty McFly or James T. Kirk so naturally they let Kirk have all the action. It should be noted that these historian’s eyebrow game is on fleek. </span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-40578 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Historian-new-300x172.png" alt="Historian new" width="729" height="418" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Historian-new-300x172.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Historian-new-298x170.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Historian-new.png 551w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /></p>
<p>Oh and also one of the historians is a giant bird. Which is excellent.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-40597 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aleek-om-300x225.jpg" alt="Aleek-om" width="979" height="734" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aleek-om-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aleek-om-768x576.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aleek-om-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aleek-om-620x465.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aleek-om.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its at this point when there is supposed to be a huge amount of heightenin. When we&#8217;re supposed to really feel the sci-fi, feel invested and being to feel the drama. The historians and their Enterprise help don’t recognize Spock. There is something that really truly falls flat for me here… something that is not executed well. And that’s Bones. The writing doesn’t feel like him. He acts all demure and go with the flow and never overly excited or put out by the chaos around him. Also the voice acting is really not great. I am not blaming the actor necessarily, we’re in the 70s Trek was not a giant priority for networks it had to fight for every gasp of air and resources it received so it&#8217;s not unusual to have something suddenly feel… different. Off. Rushed. Whatever happened it&#8217;s pretty mood breaking for me but we’ll continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody can remember Spock. And even though they are standing right by the most VITAL PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE AND POWER IN THE ENTIRE GALAXY nobody is phased whatsoever at having a total stranger around. One who if he wanted could jump through the portal and remake all of creation in his own image. Overly trusting Federation am I right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirk beams the landing party up to the Enterprise right away. Again nobody recognizes Spock. And the person who greets them is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">this</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> timeline’s Enterprise Executive Officer an Andorian named Thelin.</span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-40586 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thelin-300x225.jpg" alt="Thelin" width="687" height="515" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thelin-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thelin-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thelin.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thelin’s eyebrows are just to die for. The alternate viewing of this episode is that this alternate timeline is one where instead of being promoted on merit you advance in society by having the most perfect eyebrow game. Sort of like the Invaders and their Tallest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally there would be a little more head scratching and theory crafting by the senior officers but this isn’t their first rodeo. They’ve been here before. They quickly understand that they changed something in the past making it so Spock’s timeline was altered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They search the computer for the history of Spock’s family. This is a point to mention how historic Spock’s family is. Everyone the era of the Enterprise is weirded out by seeing Spock because Vulcan’s don’t widely serve in Starfleet right now. Earth and Vulcan are the most alliance to galactic peace but on an individual human to Vulcan level they don’t always get along. Sarek knows this must change and becomes an incredibly historic ambassador from Vulcan to Earth. He chooses to do what is to Vulcan’s the unthinkable marry a human woman named Amanda Greyson. And through genetic engineering they have an offspring named Spock. </span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-40581 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Amanda-Greyson-300x189.png" alt="Amanda Greyson" width="713" height="449" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Amanda-Greyson-300x189.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Amanda-Greyson-768x483.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Amanda-Greyson-1200x755.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Amanda-Greyson-298x187.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Amanda-Greyson-620x390.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Amanda-Greyson.png 1218w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This family dynamic is why Nimoy’s letter to his fan from the beginning is a powerful companion piece to this episode. Spock is from two worlds but feels like he has to be twice as good. He has to succeed to show Vulcan’s can be something other than giant sticks in the mud and he has to be the most Vulcan to not be totally rejected by other Vulcans who often and heartbreakingly reject him. His faults no matter when or where they happen are attributed to his whole peoples. If he’s seen as flawed among Vulcans </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">humanity</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is flawed. If he’s seen as just impossible to work with by humans </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vulcans</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are impossible. His dad is the ambassador but Spock carries the mantel and the mission all the same. It is an unfair and an incredibly human dynamic that is universally inspirational.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However in this timeline Sarek and Amanda’s great leap of faith and love failed. Spock died at age seven. The relationship died shortly after that and in a final act of cruel fate Amanda Greyson died in a senseless shuttle crash immediately following his parents divorce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They consult their record of recent Vulcan history and find that Spock dies during the Khas-Wan. A traditional survival test. Spock remembers it well through his own memory. Its the day his mysterious cousin who he never saw before or after saved his life mysteriously. Kirk and Spock don’t need a mind meld to be on the same page here they know it’s gotta be Spock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I should mention. Vulcans have such strict tradition and such massive cultural systems of self control because their history prior to their modern culture is one of incredible violence, conflict, and domination. Vulcans are contact telepaths, at touch they can feel the others feelings and read the others mind. Primitive Vulcan’s weaponized their innate abilities and used it as a mind shattering weapon. All Vulcans believe or suspect that without their strict system of self control and discipline with all the mediation and traditional rites that little by little selfish action by selfish action that they would as a people regress into that chaos again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spock gets together an outfit that would blend in with Vulcan a few decades ago and we learn that the Enterprise has a wardrobe department?? Who knew!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thelin puts it together that Spock doing this would mean his whole life’s trajectory would change. And Andorians and Vulcans have a history of racial resentment but in an incredibly touching speech Thelin talks about how much he and his people value family, and that he hopes Spock can save his mother. When Thelin does the vulcan salute to Spock I honest to goodness tear up a bit every time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-40585 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thelin-bro-1-300x188.png" alt="Thelin bro" width="713" height="447" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thelin-bro-1-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thelin-bro-1-768x482.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thelin-bro-1-1200x753.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thelin-bro-1-298x187.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thelin-bro-1-620x389.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thelin-bro-1.png 1217w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no time to waste Spock gets his costume and goes right to the past&#8211;to his own past on Vulcan in the city of ShiKahr.</span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-40587 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Vulcan-City-1-300x188.png" alt="Vulcan City" width="702" height="440" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Vulcan-City-1-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Vulcan-City-1-768x481.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Vulcan-City-1-1200x751.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Vulcan-City-1-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Vulcan-City-1-620x388.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Vulcan-City-1.png 1208w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ShiKahr is beautiful. I love this city and I am so glad we see it in the animated series. Another example of this medium being better for realizing Roddenberry’s vision at this time and with this budget. We get to enjoy this splendor for all of two seconds however before we hear some young Vulcan bullies shouting at a poor young Spock. Making him feel that he doesn’t belong anywhere. As always with Spock the emotional core of him is his mother. When they insult Spock&#8217;s human mother young Spock attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shockingly not only is our Spock watching this, reliving his difficult past but so is Spock’s dad, Sarek. The one who initially had the vision that humanity and Vulcankind could become closer. Sarek says it is very regrettable that Spock showed emotion. Weakness. He calls his behavior regrettable. He apologizes that it has to be seen at all. To Sarek he is speaking to a complete stranger. Let that sink in enough, young Spock is 7 years old is under constant threat of physical and psychological abuse by his peers and is thought of as an overly emotional thing of embarrassment in public by Sarek. Not an easy life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spock identifies himself as a relative and is immediately welcomed into his childhood home. He speaks to Amanda Greyson and has the loaded line about the incredibly strict upbringing of Sarek: “It is difficult for a father to bear less than perfection in his son”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young Spock choses to go early to his KhasWan and his giant saber tooth bear of a pet named  I-Chaya follows. Older Spock narrates, remembering he had so much to prove to himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the desert a monster immediately attacks and I-Chaya and older Spock intervene save the life of young Spock.</span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-40595 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/animated-sehlat-300x224.jpg" alt="animated sehlat" width="713" height="532" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/animated-sehlat-300x224.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/animated-sehlat-298x223.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/animated-sehlat-620x464.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young Spock is surprised to see the person he believes to be his cousin at first but soon Spock is able to give his younger self something he desperately needs, the feeling of being accepted and understood. Finally he able to help young Spock not be alone in the universe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I-Chya is poisoned. He is not doing well. Spock quickly lets the audience member know that this wasn’t supposed to happen. Both Spocks are faced with losing a beloved pet to whom they owe their life(s). Young Spock chooses to go get help even though it is a risky journey telling Spock that it is his responsibility alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With only a few microaggressions and only one or two instances of outright racism that mar Spock&#8217;s life is able to get a healer to help. As the healer works I-Chya’s outlook becomes increasingly grim. Spock advises young Spock that a Vulcan would face this loss without tears and says: “Loss of life is to be mourned but only if the life was wasted”. I’m not crying. YOU’RE crying. Shut up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I-Chya doesn’t make it. Spock is able to return and reports to Kirk that things were to be corrected with only the loss of a pet. Kirk says: “a pet? That wouldn’t mean much to the course of time”. “It might. To some.” Spock says.</span></p>
<p>This is an important episode of Star Trek. For so many reasons. But most importantly for the reasons articulated in the letter Leonard Nimoy responded to about someone who was from two worlds who felt they belonged in neither. That&#8217;s the best of what Trek is, its a world where we work hard to make society for everyone where we are better where we are more for our differences never less. And its a world where giant saber tooth bear things make great pets and always have your back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to your newest obsession.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s murder. A lot of murder. And there&#8217;s mayhem. So much mayhem. Sex and drugs and&#8211;well, okay, there isn&#8217;t any rock and roll, but there are a bunch of teenagers who do rock. And roll. And poison, stab, seduce, and steal. From each other, from the faculty of their assassin academy, and from the people they most despise: the rest of the world, which worships the suns instead of their dark and terrible lady of night.</p>
<p>Not that you could blame them. The goddess of night is also the goddess of murder, and she has little pity in her heart, not even for the young men and women who come to serve her. Mia Corvere is especially blessed among these children of the damned, since we (a) know from the first pages that she survives a world that is basically Westeros for YA in terms of character death and (b) has power over shadows and fear itself. She is an avatar of the darkness, and knows more than her fair share about death. After all, her father was executed in front of her, and her mother made her watch. She swore revenge on his murderers, but first she needs to learn how to kill&#8211;and how to survive in order to kill again.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-39182" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nevernight-by-jay-kristoff.jpg" alt="nevernight-by-jay-kristoff" width="413" height="625" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nevernight-by-jay-kristoff.jpg 748w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nevernight-by-jay-kristoff-198x300.jpg 198w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nevernight-by-jay-kristoff-298x451.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nevernight-by-jay-kristoff-620x939.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px" /></p>
<p>Thus we find ourselves at one of the most interesting schools since Hogwarts, the Red Church. Inside a hollowed-out mountain, hidden from both the sun and the dubious light of a Roman-esque civilization, Mia and other initiates learn all the ways to kill a person and all the ways to hurt them. Over the course of a year, they will compete&#8211;sometimes with deadly results&#8211;to win one of only four coveted spots to continue their training and their vendettas. The rest will remain acolytes of the church, their private quests ended.</p>
<p>The world reminds me a bit of Meredith Ann Pierce&#8217;s Darkangel trilogy. Three suns, rare darkness, and grimness. But while Pierce had a highly symbolic universe, the Nevernight universe is grit between your teeth and toes. It doesn&#8217;t skimp on the blood or the bad feelings, and it doesn&#8217;t spare your sensibilities. Love is in short supply here, and happy endings are out of the question. That doesn&#8217;t mean there isn&#8217;t loveliness or warmth. It just means that Mia has a mission, and however heartbreaking it might be to see, she isn&#8217;t going to be put off by easy, Hollywood solutions of romance or mercy. She&#8217;s in it to win it&#8211;the competition, and then her fame as the woman who brings down an empire. And a church. And maybe even a god.</p>
<p>There are quite a few teenage assassins these days&#8211;see also <em>Throne of Glass</em>, <em>Hit</em>, and <em>His Fair Assassin</em>&#8211;but this might just be my favorite of them all. It&#8217;s quite twisted&#8211;which is to say, exactly as twisted as it needs to be to really sell me on the psychology&#8211;and physiology&#8211;of a killer. Since we witness her training, we see Mia struggling to master techniques and mask her uncertainties, not just Mary Sue-ing her way to dominion. Everything feels extremely earned here.</p>
<p>Exposition and commentary in the form of foot/endnotes litter the first half of the book especially, but fall off later. Perhaps it was my copy*, but having them as endnotes was particularly irritating. I am not eager to interrupt a fairly standard narrative structure (description, dialogue, the usual accoutrements of story) by flipping back and forth to find out whether there is going to be further explanation of an unfamiliar term or merely a sarcastic comment. (The sarcasm in particular undermines the narrative a bit, undercutting moral and emotional issues with humor as if the author is embarrassed by his own pathos.) I would have vastly preferred the snark to remain inline, or removed only parenthetically. Though I suppose the conceit of the story being written as an account of Mia&#8217;s life does&#8211;theoretically&#8211;lend itself to footnotes, this is not <em>Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell </em>or <em>House of Leaves</em>. It&#8217;s YA with extremely mature themes, or it&#8217;s an adult fantasy with teen protagonists.</p>
<p>It is, in short, a style that was still trying to find itself at the outset. I&#8217;m all for genre- and style-bending, but this was&#8230;muddled. It was like a fusion restaurant that&#8217;s trying to do too many things at once. Sure, you might love kumquats and sushi and shepherds pie, but together? Not so much. Fortunately, Kristoff finds his footing about a third of the way in, and the asides become more serious, the tone evens out, and the drama really begins to unfold. And the emotional torment. Prepare to have your heart tossed around and stepped on, and for your breath to spend most of its time caught in your throat. This is a pulse-pounding, balls-to-the-wall triumph of a book, and to top it all off, I absolutely did not see the ending(s) coming. There are several twists, all of them remarkable, all of them well-executed (heh). I stayed up way too late to find out all the secrets, and even though I was a wreck for several days, it was worth it. It was so, so worth it.</p>
<p><em>Nevernight</em> (the first book an as-yet-unknown number of books in a series) comes out on August 9th. I recommend buying it early, then either devouring it so that we can all commiserate that book two won&#8217;t be out for <em>ages</em>, or waiting so that you can just jump right into book two. Okay, you won&#8217;t actually be able to resist. So just get it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*e-ARC, Kindle, unsure whether other kindle editions will have the same issues</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A girl is missing. A student has fled from her rooms in the middle of the night after or with a young man. At first this means only—only!—that the Women&#8217;s College might be in jeopardy, a serious enough fate to force Vellitt Boe into action. But this is a world scaffolded by Lovecraft, and the reputation and potential disgrace of a college is hardly the worst the world has to offer.</p>
<p>The young man is a Dreamer, one who can affect Vellitt&#8217;s world but who can also leave it to wake up in his own. Vellitt&#8217;s student went with him, but there are reasons beyond reputation why she should not have gone. Mad gods and old ones are watching her and Vellitt both, stirring in their hallucinogenic sleep. Malicious forces are struggling to do their work. Vellitt Boe&#8217;s initially simple task of tracking her student across a moderate swath of countryside becomes a full-blown quest, spanning a far length of the Dreamlands, whose boundaries and landscape change at will and whose skies writhe with scintillating forms that the eye cannot follow for long.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-40614" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/vellitt_final-188x300.jpg" alt="vellitt_final" width="286" height="456" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s rare to encounter a book so fully and intensely <em>itself</em>. Yes, it&#8217;s heavily drawn from <em>The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</em>, but Kij Johnson has swallowed that book whole and completely digested it. It&#8217;s hers. And she&#8217;s made it into something greater.</p>
<p>Yes, Lovecraft fans, greater. Have your fits, gnash your teeth, call Harvard about getting that copy of the Necronomicon* to curse me. But take out Lovecraft&#8217;s racism, his xenophobia, his misogyny; remove his excessive reliance on a thesaurus composed only of five-syllable words; add in an actual understanding of psychology and dialogue; in short, subject the entire thing to the radical notion that horror and bigotry are not interchangeable and you have &#8220;The Dream-Quest of Vellitt Boe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vellitt is an uncompromising heroine, wise with caution and pragmatism. She is older, a welcome change from all the teen saviors so popular these days, and full of experience both of the world and her own heart. Not easily swayed by old lovers, but motivated by deep compassion for her friends and fellow learners, her quest is driven not by typical Lovecraftian strangeness but by familiar goodness and kindness. Sure, she&#8217;s a badass, able to traverse the eternally dangerous dreamlands with nothing but a good pair of shoes and her wits, full of stories of daring escapes and far sights. But she&#8217;s no foolhardy hero, getting into scrapes for the sake of adventure or power. She&#8217;s just a wanderer, driven by curiosity, protected by her learning.</p>
<p>Traveling with Vellitt is a wonderful reminder of the classic quest-books, in which heroes like Belgarion and Frodo traveled all around their mythic globes with some bauble to provide the excuse for a tour. We see so much, learn so much about strange places. And there&#8217;s never much drive to make everything <em>mean</em> something. In some novels, everything comes together and ties up the narrative in a pretty bow. That&#8217;s all well and good (as long as it&#8217;s executed properly), but sometimes it&#8217;s nice to sink into a story in which the main character&#8211;though possessed of a legitimate motivation&#8211;runs afoul of beasts or lands that simply <em>are</em>. It makes the world so much bigger, knowing that not everything revolves around this single story.</p>
<p>This is part of the point Kij Johnson is trying to make about Lovecraft and Lovecraftian heroes as well. We do encounter Randolph Carter at one point, and he is (still) under the impression that the dream-world revolves around him. In this sense, Vellitt is the antithesis of all those quest narratives, in which the heroes usually end up as kings and legends. There&#8217;s no fame here, and no Valinor. Life very much goes on, but lucky us, we get to be part of it.</p>
<p><em>The Dream-Quest of Vellitt Boe</em> comes out August 16.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*Widener Library, the central library for Harvard University, emphatically does not have a copy of the &#8220;original,&#8221; which is, obviously, fictitious. Every so often librarians there get a call from people who want to see it and won&#8217;t take no for an answer. Don&#8217;t be that person who annoys a librarian (whom, I might add, in your delusions, <i>has</i> <i>access to the Necronomicon</i>). You&#8217;d be much better off visiting the Andover Library, which serves Harvard Divinity School, to see the book bound in human skin (which <i>is</i> real). But they don&#8217;t really take it out much, so don&#8217;t be too keen or you&#8217;re in for some uncomfortable conversations with police.</p>

<p>Bam! Teleported into the middle of a battle. Arrows and magic fly by our heads and kill our new best friends. Their is a loud noise coming from a huge mechanical&#8230;thing.

<p>&#8216;Ello our esteemed messers and misses &#8211; we are pleased to invite you to another evening (or morning or afternoon &#8211; we have no idea when you listen to this podcast) of magic and mystery.</p>
<p>This week, as always, a contentious round of the Quizzich Cup &#8211; perhaps a more fruitful round than last episode? We also take a trip via the Floo Network to Flourish and Blotts by way of Knockturn Alley, find a creepy hand and a curious wardrobe* (*hold for later), and meet Mr. Lockheart in the flesh. <em>And</em> we talk with Fiona Chase, Vice Secretary (Second Class) of the North American Chapter of Gilderoy Lockheart&#8217;s Fanclub.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zombies.  Necromancers.  Boobs.  Dapper Dressed Animals.  Magical Girls and Boys.  Pudding Monsters.  This month I watched<em> Is This a Zombie</em>, and boy was it interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I wrote about Glitter Force a few months ago, I mentioned that it was like the essence of the magical girl genre &#8211; made in a lab.  <em>Is This a Zombie</em> has a very similar vibe, except that it’s the concentrated goo of the best and worst parts of anime.  It’s so upfront about its weirdness that it’s wonderfully fun to watch.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_40519" style="width: 821px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-40519" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/puddingif-1-300x169.gif" alt="I wasn't kidding about the pudding monster." width="811" height="457" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/puddingif-1-300x169.gif 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/puddingif-1-600x338.gif 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/puddingif-1-298x168.gif 298w" sizes="(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I wasn&#8217;t kidding about the pudding monster.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Is This a Zombie</em> also dips heavily into the supernatural teen genre, with a cast of characters so over the top you’d think it was some top notch fanfiction.  The main character, Ayamu, is a somewhat hopeless teen boy with major delusions about the women around him.  Oh, also he was brutally murdered and brought back as a zombie.  Being a zombie impacts Ayamu’s life remarkably little, with the only real downside being that he can’t go out in the sun.  It’s the women that come to live with him that make his life a lot more difficult.  First up is Eucliwood Hellscythe (Eu), which, aside from being my new favorite name ever, is a necromancer from Hades who resurrects Ayamu after he is murdered.  She very, very rarely talks or shows emotion because her magic is so powerful that even speaking can have unintended consequences for her.  Despite the fact that Ayamu has frequent lewd daydreams about her and that she considers him a servant, they have a remarkably strong relationship and respect for each other.  Less respectful are Ayamu’s other two housemates: Haruna and Sera.  Haruna is a Magical Garment Girl from a world called Villiers, who carries a magical pink chainsaw named Mystletain and fights animal shaped monsters in tuxedos called Megalos.  She joins them when Ayamu accidentally steals her powers and becomes the shows official magical girl.  Haruna is brash, energetic, and constantly beats the shit out of Ayamu.  And right behind her is Sera (short for Seraphim), a big breasted vampire ninja who consistently calls Ayamu “maggot” and yells her only attack like a Digimon.  Sera shows up hoping to serve Eu, and is rather miffed that Ayamu is technically already serving her.  Sera and Haruna consistently call Ayamu out on being a pervert, and while they’re often not wrong that leads me to the main troubling portions of the show.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_40522" style="width: 707px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-40522" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/koreha-girls-300x117.jpg" alt="Gird yourself." width="697" height="272" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/koreha-girls-300x117.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/koreha-girls-298x116.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/koreha-girls-620x242.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/koreha-girls.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Gird yourself.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said that this show has the best of anime, but it’s also got the worst.  Whenever Ayamu transforms into his Magical Garment Girl form, the other characters waste no time calling him a “tranny pervert” almost every time.  It’s really regrettable language and is consistently the main running joke of the show.  The fact that the girls grow to respect Ayamu’s ability to be a Magical Garment Girl doesn’t do much to forgive the amount of transphobic language in the show.  There is a major immaturity to the humor of the show, it’s definitely geared towards teenagers and less adult adults.  There’s more than once where Ayamu getting a bamboo spear in the ass is played as a hilarious joke.  And the girls aren’t immune either, for every time they call Ayamu a pervert, there are panty shots, ridiculous boob shots, and a very extended bathing scene.  Most of the time the show is reveling in it’s ridiculousness so much that it almost pulls it off, but it’s definitely not always handled super well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magical girl elements of the show are super fun, the writers were clearly having fun with the conventions beyond simply making a male character into a magical girl.  When Ayamu powers up he gains frills and bows on his costume, with cuteness directly correlating to power.  And seeing anybody in a frilly outfit slicing open a flying blue whale with a glowing chainsaw is incredibly fun to watch.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_40521" style="width: 684px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-40521" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ayamu-2-300x117.jpg" alt="He will fuck you up. Adorably." width="674" height="263" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ayamu-2-300x117.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ayamu-2-298x116.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ayamu-2-620x242.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ayamu-2.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">He will fuck you up. Adorably.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That reveling in its trashiness is certainly appealing though.  <em>Is This a Zombie</em> is unabashedly weird, confusing, stupid, dramatic and self aware of all those facts.  It’s almost amazing that it manages to produce some well rounded, interesting characters within all that mess.  It’s teen drama soaked in supernatural powers with a side order of meta.  The fourth wall is constantly broken into smithereens.  And yes, it has upsetting elements and those do not redeem it.  But the weird earnestness of the show won me over, and I had a genuinely fun time watching it.  It’s like eating an entire tub of ice cream, you wouldn’t do it all the time* and you feel kind of bad after, but damn if you don’t enjoy it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*I do actually do this all the time</span></p>

<h2><em>Justice League #52 (DC Comics)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Dan Jurgens<br />
Pencils: Tom Grummett</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h3>
<p>The last issue of New-52 <em>Justice League a</em>nd it doesn’t even have anything to do with the Justice League. Or at least, that’s what I’m expecting. And it’s written by Dan Jurgens, who I don’t like. Alas, first impressions are not good. Here’s hoping I’m wrong.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict:</strong></h3>
<p>Sitting next to my desk is a cup of lukewarm English breakfast tea. It still has flavor, but I’m not really getting anything out of drinking it. This is how I feel about <em>Justice League #52</em>. Were I a Superman fan, I would no doubt have strong feelings about this issue. Lex Luthor assuming the mantle of Superman will no doubt be a divisive move for the series. I of course can appreciate the idea of trying to be a better man, and to be fair, Dan Jurgens does this well. The issue is in no way painful or laborious to read. It is however, nothing to do with the Justice League. And so, unfortunately, I can’t really offer any concrete thoughts on it. So, in the end, a mildly enjoyable issue with perfectly serviceable art. Maybe. Don’t quote me on that.</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40478" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/flash-1.jpg" alt="The Flash #1 2016" width="520" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/flash-1.jpg 520w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/flash-1-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/flash-1-298x458.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></h2>
<h2><em>The Flash #1 (DC Comics)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Joshua Williamson<br />
Pencils: Carmine Di Giandomenico</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h3>
<p>No doubt you can guess what I’ll say here. I’ve already talked about the team for this new run on <em>The Flash</em>, so I won’t do again. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed <em>The Flash: Rebirth #1</em>, finding it to be a great introduction to the character. The team is solid, so there’s no reason why this won’t be a great kick-off point. As an aside, I’m really digging the pulpy, newsprint vibe coming from this month’s cover, very cool.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict:</strong></h3>
<p>Good, but sadly not up to the high levels of other Rebirth titles. Similar to <em>Flash: Rebirth #1, </em>we again get a sort of overview of Barry Allen&#8217;s character and his life. Who he hangs out with, what he does when he’s not The Flash — that sort of thing. It’s the issue&#8217;s strength, easily, and for someone who knows (comparatively) little about The Flash, it’s a good first issue. That, combined with Barry’s ever present narration to himself, means that the issue gives a great sense of who Barry is, building on <em>Rebirth</em>. Carmine Di Giandomenico’s art has a fantastic, rough, pulpy feel that I’m really digging. It actually somehow manages to feel quick, which for The Flash, I’m thinking is a good thing. And yet, it all kind of falls short.</p>
<p>It took me a while to put my finger on what was bothering me so much about it, but oddly enough, it’s the pace of the story. While I understand it’s the first issue and some time needs to be taken, a story about the literal fastest man alive should have a reasonable amount of speed behind it. There’s just a little too much time spent standing and talking, when it could be spent running. And unfortunately, while the inner narration is great, conversations are not up to that same standard. They don’t feel particularly natural and there’s a little too much exposition forced into too small spaces. That said, the ending of the issue is dynamite and raises some real eyebrows. So, with a bit of screw tightening, I see no reason why <em>The Flash</em> couldn’t be one the best around.</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40479" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/aquaman-1.jpg" alt="Aquaman #1 2016" width="520" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/aquaman-1.jpg 520w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/aquaman-1-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/aquaman-1-298x458.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></h2>
<h2><em>Aquaman #1 (DC Comics)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Dan Abnett<br />
Pencils: Brad Walker</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions:</strong></h3>
<p><em>Aquaman: Rebirth #1 </em>was perhaps my favourite of all the Rebirth one-shots I picked up. It had a clear, interesting overview of the world of Aquaman and it did a great job of telling me who he was. On top of that, it managed to set a real, emotional connection between Aquaman and his wife Mera. That last bit is important as it also piled on a bit of heavy foreshadowing that Mera would be in danger in future issues. With a seriously kick-ass cover and a solid issue behind it, I’m very excited for this first chapter.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict:</strong></h3>
<p>Fantastic. A truly excellent piece of comic book sci-fi with a healthy and well-executed dose of political intrigue. Continuing the theme from <em>Aquaman: Rebirth #1</em>, we&#8217;re centered firmly on Aquaman&#8217;s efforts to join land and sea. Namely his opening of Spindrift Station, an embassy between Atlantis and the surface. Dan Abnett has done such a good job on every level here. Arthur and Mera&#8217;s relationship is cemented further in the first few week’s pages and their conversation not only gives a bit more meat to their relationship but provides context for the embassy opening. Without being long-winded or ham-fisted, Abnett makes you care about Mera and understand the stakes behind the embassy in a very short period.</p>
<p>He then makes the genius decision to shift the point of view entirely. While we could have seen the embassy open from Aquaman&#8217;s point of view, it perhaps wouldn&#8217;t have given the right sense of scale. By switching to the Royal Navy Ambassador, Joanna Stubbs, it makes the whole ordeal that much more impressive. We get a sense of just how big a deal this is and a perspective on Atlantean culture and people that may not have otherwise been provided. Most importantly it makes Aquaman&#8217;s eventual entrance that much more grand. Abnett reminds us (not that subtly) that Aquaman is both a superhero and a king. This makes the slow, thoughtful beginning that much more of a contrast to the sudden and violent ending that we get. Brad Walker&#8217;s art is also to be commended. It’s strong and precise, with each panel selected carefully. It’s nothing I&#8217;ve not seen before, but it’s always good to see something classic executed well. Aquaman is so far a real standout, and if Abnett manages to keep this kind of quality up, I and many other readers will be incredibly happy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40481" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wonder-woman-1.jpg" alt="wonder-woman-1" width="640" height="984" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wonder-woman-1.jpg 640w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wonder-woman-1-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wonder-woman-1-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wonder-woman-1-620x953.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Wonder Woman #1 (DC Comics)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Greg Rucka<br />
Pencils: Liam Sharp</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions:</strong></h3>
<p>The cover. My goodness that cover. It’s so good. I can’t get over how good it is. Well, anyway. Expectations are pretty high for this one. Greg Rucka is regarded as easily one of the best Wonder Woman writers around and while <em>Wonder Woman: Rebirth #1 </em>was a little odd, it was still fantastic. Not only did it acknowledge the mistakes of the past, it actually used them as a launching point for the next arc with Wonder Woman now determined to discover just what exactly is the truth about her past.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict:</strong></h3>
<p>Potentially the best Rebirth comic yet. What is immediately obvious here is just how gorgeous the comic is. Every bit of the art is exactly where it should be. Lines, inks, colours, even panel layout is adding to the story. There are even a couple bits this issue that are fun to just look at — that is the kind of quality we’re talking about here. There’s this very subtle difference too, between Wonder Woman’s sections and the mortals discussing her. It’s only a slight shift in pallet and hue, but it’s enough to place Wonder Woman firmly in a world other than our own. This difference extends to the actual writing as well. Wonder Woman looks and reads like a Greek myth, there a shadowy grandness to her pictures and to her speech. It makes her feel like a genuine, old-style hero and it is seriously quite cool. This makes the people talking about her in parallel that much more normal, despite talking about a superhero wandering through the back-jungle of an African nation. This contrast, this clear effort to make Wonder Woman apart from the normal world, really makes it all that much more enjoyable and makes me incredibly excited for the rest of the series. With the next issue kicking off a separate arc and the next part of this story not till next month, August can’t come soon enough.</p>

<h2><em>The Autumnlands #11 (Image)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Kurt Busiek<br />
Art: Benjamin Dewey and Jordie Bellaire</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions:</strong></h3>
<p>Sketchy. It’s a been a while since the last issue of Kurt Busiek’s anthropomorphic fantasy tale, which is par for the course really. One can’t complain as it is consistently one the strongest comics around. With the champion, Leroy, and the dog wizard Dunstin, attacked by a mutant goat monster at the end of the last issue, I’m keen to see the teams take on a large scale, monstrous battle. The fight against the bison in issue 6 was excellent, so here’s hoping for more of that.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict:</strong></h3>
<p>An excellent set up issue that, as per usual, raises more questions than it answers. The fight against the goat-monster is excellently epic with a healthy dose of magic. Special mention has to go the traditional second page splash which this week is a simply gorgeous rendition of the battle that I would happily throw up on my wall. The battle is handled well, and unlike previous issues, Leroy does not in fact save the day. Dusty does. It’s great to see him coming to the fore after all this time, and I’m looking forward to how the consequences of his magic will be dealt with. The battle was surprisingly poignant at the end and I’m particularly excited to see Aelbert join the gang on a full time basis. Leroy and Dusty have a good dynamic, but I have to wonder how long it could have gone on for without becoming stale.</p>
<p>The latter half of the issue, where our heroes finally met the mysterious statue women, is also good. Without spoiling too much, it is a bit of story that is very typical of <em>The Autumnlands</em>. Namely, it’s very difficult to understand just what happening. Not on a surface level of course, but rather, what’s happening behind the scenes. Who are these women? Why are they here doing what they’re doing? None of these questions are answered in the slightest and, while the payoff will no doubt be worth it, it does make the issue a very slight let down from last month. It feels like there’s no real reward. Considering there’s such a gap between issues, it is mildly frustrating. Nevertheless, this is still <em>The Autumnlands</em>, and with some big things to no doubt come, you’d be mad not to pick it up.</p>

<h2><strong><em>Clean Room #9 (Vertigo)</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Gail Simone<br />
Pencils: Jon Davis-Hunt</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h3>
<p><em>Clean Room </em>has been one of the trippiest, most bizarre comics to ever grace my box since the day #1 came out. Part sci-fi romp, part body-horror extravaganza, I find <em>Clean Room </em>hard to classify. Previously the entire story had been flipped on its head with villain-turned-hero corporate overlord Astrid Mueller shot in the gut by her own brother (very unexpectedly I might add). With such a strong character cut down, it was time for our original main character, Chloe, to step forward. On top of that we’re finally getting a little more a glimpse at the mysterious alien threat that Astrid has worked so hard to deter. With Astrid dying in the ‘Clean Room’ and Chloe having released one of said aliens, I’m looking forward to more psychotropic weirdness.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict: </strong></h3>
<p>Enjoyable, and still full of questions, but without the big narrative punch of previous issues. Said alien that was released in the Clean Room by Chloe, Spark, after some cajoling and threatening saves Astrid’s life. In amongst that is a flashback to Astrid’s younger days and her apparent retrieval of a component of the all-important Clean Room. Most importantly, however, was the first few pages wherein another, separate, corporate entity was revealed to be working against Astrid. With the ‘aliens’ being the primary, but still aloof, threat; it’ll be great to have Astrid and Chloe working against something a little more tangible and human.</p>
<p>Outside of that though I just couldn’t get my blood racing about much that was in here. I suppose that considering the shocking way that Astrid’s life was threatened, I was expecting something a little more when it came to saving it. The biggest issue, and the one that contributed the most to the issues weakness, was Chloe. It was great to see her driving the story and actually getting out there and doing things, but it felt just a little out of character. It’s understandable that Chloe needs to progress into a more active person, but not overnight, and a great number of lines from her sounded just plain weird. Nevertheless, this is still <em>Clean Room</em>. John Davis-Hunt, while most likely a bit bored with drawing the plain whiteness of the Clean Room, he does have a bit of fun with Spark and the art is just as good as past issues. An issue of what is sure to become ever important set-up, let down by slightly odd characterization.</p>

<h2><strong><em>Justice League #51 (DC Comics)</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Dan Abnett<br />
Pencils: Paul Pellitier</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions:</strong></h3>
<p>I have to feel a little sorry for <em>Justice League</em>. Well, in so much as one can feel sorry for a comic book series. Last month, <em>Justice League </em>wrapped up the cosmic-shaking epic that was Darkseid War. It ended on a powerful note with just the right amount of teasers, and was a suitable epic for the series to go out on. The end was timed particularly well with <em>DC Universe: Rebirth</em> coming out very shortly afterwards. With the Leagues future uncertain, it was a great end point. But here we are with another 2 issues to go, and I just can’t help but think that someone, somewhere is just ticking a box when these come out. The fact that Geoff Johns is no longer on this does reek to me of a kind of weary resignation around the series. I’m expecting, honestly, weak-sauce filler.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict:</strong></h3>
<p>A decidedly mixed bag. This issue of <em>Justice League</em> is intended to lead into <em>Titans: Rebirth</em> and then into the main <em>Titans</em> series. And I can respect that. There’s plenty of teasing throughout the issue around some nameless threat that the Titans will have to no doubt throw down with at a later date. And from that point of view, the issue is a success. Robin ends up being brought along by Batman to meet the Justice League and help them fight three different interdimensional threats, and the source of the threats is genuinely intriguing. If I weren’t so poor, perhaps I would look into picking up <em>Titans</em>, just to find out what was going on. The art is also pretty stand out with some great splash pages. Each member of the league is done very well, if pretty predictably, and other than some slightly blurry faces, it’s great. Most of the issue is essentially one big battle scene, and the art and panels work really well here with the action being quite easy to follow and little being lost amongst the various punches and laser beams.</p>
<p>Despite this, however, the issue has one glaring flaw; the dialogue. There is a certain art to making comic book characters in comic book situations not sound hokey and cheesy, and this issue does not have it. Every character, and I do mean every character, sounds like they’re from the 50’s. No one seems to be having an actual conversation. Rather, it’s a glorified exchange of one-liners and clunky exposition. Quips are like salt, essential to a dish, but too much spoils the flavor. And unfortunately the dialogue here lets down what is otherwise an enjoyable issue.</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40469" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Batman-1-2016.jpg" alt="Batman-1-2016" width="480" height="738" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Batman-1-2016.jpg 480w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Batman-1-2016-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Batman-1-2016-298x458.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></h2>
<h2><em>Batman #1 (DC Comics)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Tom King<br />
Pencils: David Finch</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions:</strong></h3>
<p>Much like <em>Batman: Rebirth #1</em>, I have already talked about the team behind this new version of the Caped Crusader, so I won’t blather too much. That said, <em>Batman: Rebirth #1</em> has come out and I have to say I found it decidedly okay. The issue didn’t feel that much like a Rebirth, so much as a somewhat short and vaguely uninteresting Batman story. However, with Tom King’s new storyline set to kick off this issue, perhaps we’ll be in for something better this time round?</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict:</strong></h3>
<p>I have to honestly wonder why this was not <em>Batman: Rebirth #1</em>. It was, quite possibly, twice as good as the previous issue. Where <em>Batman: Rebirth </em>was a sort of unfocused Batman story, this feels more like an introduction into Batman as a character. And while it may not give me a full sense of what is admittedly a 75-year-old character, it does give me an idea as to where Tom King is going to be taking this. In it, we have Batman talking to Commissioner Gordon about a stolen surface to air missile. Predictably said surface to air missile then appears. It then promptly disappears into the back of a plane, sparking a race against time to stop the plane from killing thousands. It’s undeniably bananas and mildly, mildly stupid; but oh so good. This is a Batman that has plans within his plans and with just the right information from Alfred or Robin, any problem can be overcome. While this version of Batman is undoubtedly tough, he’s smart and resourceful; and its fantastic to see the Caped Crusader being taken in this direction. With a deft treatment of Batman and Gordon&#8217;s relationship, a white knuckle chase scene ripped straight from a blockbuster and surprisingly genuine and emotional finale; this is definitely a series to watch.</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40470" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/green-lanterns-1.jpg" alt="green-lanterns-1" width="400" height="615" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/green-lanterns-1.jpg 400w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/green-lanterns-1-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/green-lanterns-1-298x458.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></h2>
<h2><em>Green Lanterns #1 (DC Comics)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Sam Humphries<br />
Pencils: Robson Rocha</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions:</strong></h3>
<p>Again, I’ve covered the team for <em>Green Lanterns</em> in the past, and it’s looking pretty solid. <em>Green Lanterns</em> books pre-Rebirth have been, overall, pretty average. Not terrible, but not good by any stretch. Sam Humphries <em>Green Lanterns: Rebirth #1</em> was a little better. With a healthy buddy-cop dynamic set up and a clear intention for long running stories, my hopes are high.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict:</strong></h3>
<p>While <em>Batman #1 </em>may have been an intense and oddly poignant first issue, <em>Green Lanterns </em>goes in entirely the other direction and gleefully embraces its slightly ridiculous sci-fi roots. What starts out as a routine investigation into an unauthorized alien quickly turns into something else. With an entire host of problems from a basement full of bodies to an inter-dimensional traveling tower, the whole issue feels strange in the best sort of way.</p>
<p>While <em>Green Lantern</em> has always been a sci-fi story, the very nature of the ring means that there’s a slight fantasy element to the lore. Sam Humphries seems to have jumped on this with total gusto and if this fusion of sci-fi and fantasy is what we can expect from the future, I’m more than ready. What I particularly enjoyed, much like the Rebirth one shot, is that Humphries clearly has a longer game in mind here. While his first consideration is for this current arc, the presence of a variety of teasing questions makes it obvious that some amount of actual thought has gone into this. The only real point that the issue is let down is in terms of art. It’s still great and everything from the ‘hell-tower’ to a green ring boxing glove looks fantastic. It’s just a bit uneven. The pages where Atrocitus makes his return genuinely look like they’ve been done by a different artist. But, it’s a small blemish on what is otherwise quite a fun comic book.</p>

<p>This original version of this episode is <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/drunks-and-dragons-episode-39-settling-up-with-the-darkblades/">Drunks and Dragons Episode 39</a>.</p>
<h5>Synopsis from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Drunks_and_Dragons_Episodes">Drunks and Dragons Wiki</a>:</h5>
<blockquote><p>With an unconscious half orc at their feet and no gold in sight, the party discusses what to do with <a title="Bercy Hamhands" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Bercy_Hamhands">Bercy Hamhands</a> now that <a title="Niles Blackwater" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Niles_Blackwater">Niles Blackwater</a> has run off. <a title="Aludra the Dwarf" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Aludra_the_Dwarf">Aludra</a> suggests tying hams to his hands, which <a title="Thom the Dragonborn" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Thom_the_Dragonborn">Thom</a> loves beyond belief and references through the entire episode. They tie up Hamhands and do tie some hams to his hands before he comes too. Aludra does a 180 from trying to kill him the previous episodes and feels sorry for him&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Its only the 2nd episode of Season 2 and the Quizzich Cup competition is already heating up! Will Michael be able to fend off Bijaya and Sarah to keep his decisive lead of 1 point?</p>
<p>We find out who is sitting on Harry&#8217;s bed while the Dursleys put on what can only be described as one of the the most boring dinner parties in the world. Bijaya teaches Sarah and Michael a term that you did not ask for and probably did not want to know. Finally, tune in for a heated debate about the House-Elf Freedom Movement between a S.P.E.W. Representative and a Ministry of Magic employee.</p>

<h5>Synopsis from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Drunks_and_Dragons_Episodes">Drunks and Dragons Wiki</a>:</h5>
<blockquote><p>After determining that there are two people sleeping in <a title="Old Mrs. Hamhands" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Old_Mrs._Hamhands">Old Mrs. Hamhands</a> apartment, Niles deftly picks the lock (despite <a class="mw-redirect" title="Lord Titus Harper" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lord_Titus_Harper">Harper</a> breathing down his neck). They burst in and proceed to fight <a title="Bercy Hamhands" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Bercy_Hamhands">Bercy Hamhands</a> while Old Mrs. Hamhands jumps out the window. During the fight, Niles makes him way into the other room where he finds the sacks of gold Bercy stole. Much to the party&#8217;s dismay, he grabs the gold, also jumps out the window and escapes into the night. The party defeats Bercy and then wonders what the hell to do next.</p></blockquote>

<h5>Synopsis from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Drunks_and_Dragons_Episodes">Drunks and Dragons Wiki</a>:</h5>
<blockquote><p>The party arrives in <a title="Mastwick" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Mastwick">Mastwick</a>, so much older and (debatably) wiser than the last time they were there. A greasy elf named <a title="Niles Blackwater" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Niles_Blackwater">Niles Blackwater</a> meets them on the docks and asks them to help him find <a title="Bercy Hamhands" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Bercy_Hamhands">Bercy Hamhands</a> for the <a title="Darkblades" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Darkblades">Darkblades</a>. They decide to do it, partly for the memory of <a title="Tum &quot;Darkblade&quot; Thumble" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tum_%22Darkblade%22_Thumble">Tum</a> and mostly for the money.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do you hear that sound? That low distant rumbling? It&#8217;s your favorite trio (i.e. Michael, Bijaya, and Sarah) coming at you down the track on the Hogwarts Express! That&#8217;s right, folks. We are back with another season of Yer a Wizard, Harry, and we can&#8217;t wait to talk about <em>The Chamber of Secrets</em>!</p>
<p>As our adventure continues, the Quizzich Cup returns! Will Sarah be able to defend her title? Who will emerge victorious? We also talk about the Worst Birthday Ever (who even forgets their friend&#8217;s birthday?!), we attempt not to use magic outside of school, and we discuss our misconceptions about the often unfavorably regarded second book.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Listeners, the world has been filled with much turmoil since we last recorded.  Namely of course, Penny Dreadful got abruptly canceled and is now dead like so many dicks.  We&#8217;re sorry for taking so long to release this episode, as our lives came crashing together and then apart.  That combined with the emotional shattering of the show ending left us all very tender, and it took a while for us to properly arrange our thoughts.  So our last episode covers the last three episodes of Penny Dreadful, while we all get wine drunk and rage about our emotions and issues with the ending.</p>
<p>We want to thank all of our wonderful listeners who supported us over the last 2 years, you guys made the show so much fun to do.  We also want to thank everybody who made Penny Dreadful, the show that burned so bright and so fast.  Dreadful Thoughts will die as it lived, yelling about who should bang who, into the microphone.</p>
<p>No but really, we have a new show in the works and you&#8217;ll love it.  Listen to the episode for details.</p>
<p>Your hosts have been Nika Howard (@nika_howard), Brad Brockway (@bsquared_yo), Steph Kingston (@StephOKingston) and Kym Stonick (@kymcattys)</p>

<p>The Abridged Drunks and Dragons is our attempt to making getting into the DnD Podcast easier for new listeners. Episodes have been boiled down to around 10 &#8211; 20 minutes. All the important story bits, and even more important goofs and tangents have been left in for your enjoyment.</p>
<p>This original version of this episode is <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/drunks-and-dragons-episode-34-a-flight-of-futility/">Drunks and Dragons Episode 35</a>.</p>
<h5>Synopsis from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Drunks_and_Dragons_Episodes">Drunks and Dragons Wiki</a>:</h5>
<blockquote><p>The gang flees the angry ancient black dragon, sadly with no treasure aside from <a title="The Whip of Binding" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=The_Whip_of_Binding">The Whip of Binding</a>. They now have to face down all the traps they handily avoided previously and they do well for about a minute. Unfortunately they fail the skill challenge spectacularly and <a title="Bucky" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Bucky">Bucky</a> almost gets eaten in front of them. But at the last minute <a title="Fennekin" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Fennekin">Fennekin</a> astral projects himself in long enough to distract the dragon and let them escape. Not really their finest hour.</p></blockquote>

<h5>Synopsis from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Drunks_and_Dragons_Episodes">Drunks and Dragons Wiki</a>:</h5>
<blockquote><p>The gang is surprisingly successful at fighting the <a title="Black Dragon" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Black_Dragon">Black Dragon</a>. This is mostly because they really all start to embrace their combat roles with <a class="mw-redirect" title="Lord Titus Harper" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lord_Titus_Harper">Harper</a> controlling, <a title="Aludra the Dwarf" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Aludra_the_Dwarf">Aludra</a> tanking and <a title="Thom the Dragonborn" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Thom_the_Dragonborn">Thom</a> buffing. Thom&#8217;s bardic nature starts to show itself and he does an admirable job not getting killed. Aludra gets blasted quite a bit by acid breath but she withstands it like the brick house she is.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a moment when I finished this book in which all I could do was sit and stare at the last blank page. I was physically disturbed and awed into stillness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Holy <em>shit</em>,&#8221; I said, somewhat to my husband, mostly just to say it. &#8220;This book&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t finish my sentence. I couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><em>This book</em>.</p>
<p>It begins <em>in media res</em>, which seems to give away the whole plot before it&#8217;s even begun, showing Elka in a fierce battle with her former father. Can a father be <em>former</em>? Yes and no, says the book. Your parents are an indelible stain on your life. The things they do, the skills they teach you, all of it remains. But you choose whether to spread that stain. You choose whether to look at it or shove it out of sight.</p>
<p>Elka can see the faintest of tracks through the forest, and the slightest of movements through the trees. But some things she just can&#8217;t bear to look at. So really, the very beginning gives very little away. The story isn&#8217;t really about whether her adoptive father is a murderer, but whether Elka can bear to look at things and see them for what they are. Not just her father, but her companion Penelope, who could be Elka&#8217;s twin for all the secrets she keeps. At Lyon, the woman hunting justice—and Elka—without a shred of mercy. At a whole constellation of liars and wanderers and desperate people, all of whom have their own agendas but not all of whom are thoroughly bad. And most of all, Elka has to look at herself, and decide whether she herself is thoroughly bad, or whether she can stop her father&#8217;s stain from spreading to cover her whole being.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-39011" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/9781101906125.jpg" alt="9781101906125" width="298" height="450" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/9781101906125.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/9781101906125-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /></p>
<p>All this set in a terrible world, ruined by what Elka calls the Big Stupid. It&#8217;s darkly funny. The whole book is like that, full of little moments of humor or luck or grace that will make your mouth twist into something that never quite becomes a smile. It&#8217;s too grim for that, but it&#8217;s not McCarthy&#8217;s <em>The Road</em>. It&#8217;s not that bleak. It&#8217;s <em>The Wolf Road</em>, a more fantastical cousin of that modern classic, with bloody-minded preachers and good doctors, gold rushes and a real cast of characters and stories that rounds out the world and proves that it&#8217;s gone on in all its splendid squalor.</p>
<p>Elka&#8217;s narrative voice casts a fine layer of practicality over all the wretchedness and glitter of the new world, unimpressed by either the shambling heaps people have managed to assemble in imitation of a world long destroyed, or by her own prodigious skills. She survives; that&#8217;s what she is as well as what she does. Still, despite her straightforwardness, it&#8217;s incredible to watch her journey over the harsh terrain. This is <em>Hatchet</em> for grown-ups, if <em>Hatchet </em>were written by Stephen King living in the Canadian wilds instead of the Overlook Hotel.</p>
<p>The forest is its own character and its own voice, sprawling across the narrative like a rich green shadow. It&#8217;s dark, yes, but it&#8217;s the kind of darkness you can sink into without fear of getting so lost you never come out again. Especially with Elka as your guide. She&#8217;s a disciple of the forest, its priestess for all that it&#8217;s no god. It&#8217;s just a solid, true thing, a foundation from which she can start and a place she can return to in desperate need. It may be harsh, full of bears and wolves and the threat of hunger and thirst, but it doesn&#8217;t have the darkness of the towns. Elka can&#8217;t navigate that kind of darkness, the kind that springs from greed and malice and not survival. She can be naive, frustratingly so at times, getting herself into situations that require others to rescue her. But she does her fair share of rescuing, too, filling the book with dramatic escapes, fights, and even a murder or two.</p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s a page-turner, and some of you may come and leave this book with no more than that. All well and good, but the real drama is in Elka&#8217;s evolving psychology, a journey just as harrowing as the one she takes over land and water. And in the end, her confrontation with her erstwhile parent is so much more than it seems from those first pages, a more terrible and heart-wrenching confrontation with her demons than you or she could ever have guessed. One that I hope will leave you just as speechless and impressed and gut-punched as I was.</p>

<p>The white raven has finally come and with it, the winds of winter have arrived. With this episode, HBO has ruined the SEO for the next book forever, but they&#8217;ve also managed one of the best episodes of their run.</p>
<p>We all predicted what Cersei&#8217;s plan was, but the way the show handled it was a masters class in film making. Arya&#8217;s triumphant return to Westeros had us out of our chairs screaming and Jon Snow finally has a mom&#8230;well Bran knows who is mom is.</p>
<p>This was an excellent capstone to an incredible season and closed the arcs we&#8217;ve been working on for so long. Thank you all for taking the ride with us. Keep riding that donkey, until next season.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In honor of Pride and to celebrate the diversity of gender and sexuality in the face of hate, here is a list of books with LGBTQIA characters.

(Also, it&#8217;s mega-awesome.) The main character is asexual, ass-kicking, and complex, bound by her family but drawn to the solitude of the forest. Also, she&#8217;s a female berserker, something I&#8217;ve never seen outside an MMORPG. Plus, necromancy and dire evil and a kingdom in peril!</p>

It clocks in at about 2,200 pages across three books, and it&#8217;s not until the second book that you really get to see two girls begin the slow dance of courtship. These girls are all different, and I don&#8217;t mean that in terms of the elements they wield. There are vastly different psychological portraits of being a teenager, all of them complicated and grounded in reality.</p>

A dashing gentleman thief and royal spy meets a poor but talented huntsman, and&#8230;well, sparks <em>do</em> fly, but they&#8217;re as much magical conflagrations and parts of clever ruses as they are romantic. Exciting, endearing, and just damn fun.</p>

Her tutor is another sexy, deadly witch, but ultimately it&#8217;s Herculine who must find her own power and her own path as the first witch who has ever had male characteristics to go along with her female ones.</p>

Is it an orientation? A different spectrum? It&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll need to discuss. In the meantime, this book is set in a world that is exceptionally accepting because of the way its religion evolved. Phaedra is a bisexual sex worker (in a world in which prostitutes are the equivalent of a priesthood) who has been blessed by one of the god-angels to take pleasure from pain. She navigates many loves and many horrors in order to revenge herself on a woman equally gifted at inflicting pain as Phaedra is at transforming it.</p>

Also features a wisecracking crow and the philosophy of reindeer, which is honestly rather a nice one.</p>

Sly, humorous, and deadly clever, Vohannes is a fantastic character, and his speech at the end in defiance of those who hate his sexuality made me want to stand up and cheer. In real life, we can only stand up to those who quote religion. Vohannes literally hurls his defiance at god himself.</p>

<h2><em>Green Lantern Corps: Edge of Oblivion #6</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Tom Taylor<br />
Pencils: Jack Hebert</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h3>
<p>The final chapter in an oft-troubled series. I have taken no pains to disguise the fact that <em>Edge of Oblivion </em>has not been my favourite series. It was never really going to go to fantastic places, having spun out of another rather mediocre limited Green Lantern Corps series. When the premise of your story is that the universe is literally ending in a few days, there are only a few places you can go. The last couple of issues have been a bit of a step up, but it still can’t erase the taste of the first few which undoubtedly stunk. I’m incredibly curious as to how Tom Taylor expects to conclude such a story in one issue without actually killing the entire corps or resorting to deus ex machina. Or worse, rushing the whole thing and still not giving a satisfying conclusion.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict:</strong></h3>
<p>A surprisingly emotional finale that almost redeems the series’ lackluster beginnings. Previously, Asuras and Dismas had revealed their true, tentacled forms, promised to devour the universe and a battle of epic proportions was set to commence. And that was, admittedly, what we got and what I expected. What I did not expect was a mildly thoughtful narration on the Green Lantern Corps sacrifice. It really helps to lend a little more weight to the final few pages and so when the Corps (inevitably) cast themselves into the glowing rift at the end of the universe, there’s a little bit of genuine sadness. Taylor seems to have taken a moment to really reinforce that at the end of the day the Green Lantern Corps members are all heroes willing to do what’s right. And it makes for a perfectly pleasant read. The story is of course let down by a mild piece of Green Lantern related deus ex machina that has reared its head before. Namely, with enough will, anything can and will happen. On top of that the art can at times be a little messy with a few battle scenes descending into blurry, muddy confusion. It does unfortunately distract from what is otherwise a decent closer to an incredibly uneven mini-series.</p>

<h2><em>Aquaman: Rebirth #1</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Dan Abnett<br />
Pencils: Scot Easton and Oscar Jiminez</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h3>
<p>I’ve covered this in some detail previously, so I won’t harp on too much. The skinny of it is that Dan Abnett is a highly regarded sci-fi writer and his interpretation of Aquaman is bound to be fabulous. Expecting many great things here.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict: </strong></h3>
<p>This is the exact sort of issue I’ve been expecting from DC Rebirth. Opening on Aquaman pursuing an Atlantean terrorist cell, <em>Aquaman: Rebirth</em> is an unseen narrator’s ruminations on who and what Aquaman is. As someone who hasn’t read a lot of Aquaman, I now have a (I think) solid understanding of his character and his rough place in the world. Abnett uses the issue as a place to briefly catch up new readers and also start setting up new story arcs. He even goes so far as to acknowledge that yes, a lot of people think of Aquaman as ‘the guy who talks to fish’. What I also particularly liked the handling of Aquaman and Mera’s relationship. She came across as a near equal to him and a brief moment they share at the end (which I won’t spoil) really cements their relationship and makes me genuinely care. I want them to stay together and be happy. <em>Aquaman: Rebirth</em> works so well because it’s a strong portrayal of the character. But, it’s an equally as strong portrayal of the world he lives in and the wider sense that it gives the reader is a great strength. Dan Abnett has me very excited for more <em>Aquaman. </em></p>

<h2><em>The Flash: Rebirth #1</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Joshua Williamson<br />
Pencils: Carmine Di Giandomenico</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h3>
<p>I started my investigations into Rebirth totally uninterested in <em>The Flash</em>. When I saw Joshua Williamson’s past books however, I was confident that <em>The Flash </em>would be one of the books to get. Like <em>Aquaman</em>, I’ve already talked pretty extensively about him, but rest assured this should be equally as cracking.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict: </strong></h3>
<p>A tad jumbled, but still a solid foundation for not only <em>The Flash</em> but also the wider mystery of the DC Universe. The issue opens on Barry Allen at a fresh crime scene that bears an eerie similarity to his mother’s murder many years before. What follows is somewhat similar to <em>Aquaman: Rebirth;</em> a look at who The Flash is and a look back at what’s made him who he is. <em>The Flash: Rebirth</em> is a little more introspective than other Rebirth issues. Namely in that Williamson isn’t so concerned with giving the reader a sense of the wider world of The Flash, so much as he wants us to understand who The Flash is and how he feels about things. It’s a great approach, makes the story feel more personal and really fits the character of The Flash; a hero who I’ve always seen as being a little more personal than the others. Muddying the waters a little bit for Joshua Williamson is the return of Wally West and the investigation into what caused the trouble the DC Universe is now facing. While it is great to see an acknowledgement of a huge plot point for the DC Universe, it does kind of take away from a comic that is primarily intended to be about Barry. That aside, <em>The Flash: Rebirth </em>is a solid introduction to the character, if not the world, of The Flash. Glad I picked this one up.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-39021 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ww.jpg" alt="ww" width="600" height="923" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ww.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ww-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ww-298x458.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2><em>Wonder Woman: Rebirth #1</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Greg Rucka<br />
Pencils: Matthew Clark and Liam Sharp</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h3>
<p>Astronomical, most likely too high. Greg Rucka is regarded as one of the best Wonder Woman writers around (<a href="http://geeklyinc.com/dc-rebirth-rundown-superman/">as I said before</a>), and this series will most likely become one of DC Rebirth’s best.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict: </strong></h3>
<p>I’m not sure how to call this one. It was good, don’t mistake me, and I’m very excited to read what comes next. It was also very, very weird. A central theme of Rucka’s run has been reported to be who exactly Wonder Woman is. After her origin was (to the outrage of many fans) retconned, he’s promised to delve deeper into the truth about her past. And <em>Wonder Woman: Rebirth</em> does just that. Sort of. It’s fairly clever in that it acknowledges the multiple origins of Wonder Woman, presenting them as multiple memories that Wonder Woman herself possesses. As she attempts to recall her true past, the story switches back and forth until neither she nor the reader can really tell what the heck is going on. And in a way that is a strength and a weakness of <em>Wonder Woman: Rebirth</em>. It is totally unafraid to try and tackle deeper ideas than, say, <em>Green Lanterns: Rebirth</em>; but can also get a little lost in its own thoughts. However, with a strong message in the end about the nature of lies and the pursuit of the truth, Rucka does eventually tie the whole thing together. If this kind of writing, and this level of fantastic art, is indicative of what’s to come for <em>Wonder Woman</em>, I’d confidently say we’re in for a treat.</p>

<p>While Tyrion is trying to make a case for the improvements he has made in the city, the Masters are bombing the shit out of Meereen. Dany has a solution to their problems &#8211; she is going to crucify all the Masters and burn their cities. Hearing this, Tyrion tells her of her father&#8217;s plans to burn King&#8217;s Landing when the Lannister army was at his gates; her plans are eerily the similar. He has a different approach in mind and Dany agrees to try his way first. They meet with the 3 representatives of the Masters, who smugly tell her that all she needs to do is leave with her foreign friends while the Unsullied and Missandei will go back to being slaves. LOL, there was clearly a miscommunication because Dany is not there to surrender; she is there to talk about the Masters&#8217; surrender. The dudes look real chuckled because they think she can&#8217;t handle the reality of the situation, but they also don&#8217;t see Drogon flying behind them. Drogon comes to Dany, who hops on, and they take off to burn some of the ships. Rhaegal and Viserion break out (?) of their dungeon room and join their mom and brother in burning ships. (Question: did their cell door get blown out by a bomb, ordered blown out by Dany, or did they have the strength to blow it out the whole time but stayed in because they&#8217;re good dragon puppers who listen to their mom?). On the ground, the Sons of the Harpy are murdering people but then a hoard of screaming Dothraki come riding, along with Daario, and it is very good.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-39036" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gotmp101715ep609-56911jpg-19a985_765w-300x200.jpg" alt="gotmp101715ep609-56911jpg-19a985_765w" width="809" height="539" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gotmp101715ep609-56911jpg-19a985_765w-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gotmp101715ep609-56911jpg-19a985_765w-298x198.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gotmp101715ep609-56911jpg-19a985_765w-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gotmp101715ep609-56911jpg-19a985_765w.jpg 765w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /></p>
<p>As Dany is wreaking havon on the fleet, Greyworm advises the soldiers guarding the dudes to go home to their families unless they want to die for men who wouldn&#8217;t die for them and the soldiers &#8220;OK BYE&#8221; out of there. Missandei tells the dudes that Dany has commanded one of them to die and, in a real jerk fashion, the two offer the low born &#8220;outsider&#8221; to be killed. Greyworm steps up to the man as he&#8217;s pleading for his life and slices the throats of the other two in one swing instead. Tyrion tells the one left to tell his people what happened when the Dragon Queen came to Meereen.</p>

<p>Later, Dany meets with Yara and Theon, who have used Littlefinger&#8217;s jetpack to reach Meereen super fast. Tyrion still holds a grudge against Theon for all the jokes he made at Tyrion&#8217;s expense the last time he visited Winterfell. Dany asks Theon if he wants her to support his claim to the Seastone Chair in exchange of lending her their fleet and Theon says he&#8217;s not fit to rule; Dany would be supporting Yara&#8217;s claim. Dany inquires about whether there had ever been a female ruler of the Iron Islands and Yara tells her no more than Westeros. Boom. When Dany says that Tyrion told her how terrible of a King Balon was, Yara says they have that in common. Boom. Theon informs Dany that Euron is building more ships and will sail to Meereen to propose marriage. When Dany asks if marriage was not a condition to Yara and Theon&#8217;s proposal, Yara says &#8220;no&#8221;, but she is up for anything. They just want her to give them back the Iron Islands and help them murder an uncle or two who don&#8217;t think a woman is fit to rule. Man, Dany loves Yara&#8217;s sassy ass answers. Dany has one condition to their forming an alliance: the Iron born will no longer rape, ravage, or reave. After an initial pause, because this has been their way of life for so long, Yara agrees and they shake on forging an alliance. I watched this episode in a room full of Geeklies and there was one consensus: we wanted Dany and Yara to kiss.</p>

<p>Jon and Co. are meeting with Ramsay and his party to talk things over before the actual battle on the morrow. Ramsay thanks Jon for bringing him Sansa back and suggests Jon get down from his horse and kneel before Ramsay. Jon does not and Lyanna Mormont mean mugs Ramsay. Ramsay reminds Jon that he has more men and horses than Jon, which means that a lot of men will be slaughtered, so Jon should just kneel. Jon concedes that he has less men than Ramsay and suggests they fight one on one,  since one of their deaths would seal the fate of the battle. Ramsay knows that Jon is a better swordsman than he, so he declines. Jon and Ramsay are both trying to get a rise out of each other; Jon asks if Ramsay&#8217;s men will fight for him when they find out he wouldn&#8217;t fight for them and Ramsay shows Jon the head of Shaggydog as proof of his possession of Rickon. Sansa cuts Ramsay off and tells him that he will die tomorrow and bids him to sleep well before riding off. This just tickles Ramsay pink. He tells the rest of them that his dogs are dying to meet them because he hasn&#8217;t fed them for 7 days. ANIMAL CRUELTY ALERT.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-39046 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/12-300x169.jpg" alt="12" width="807" height="454" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/12-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/12-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/12-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/12.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" /></p>
<p>Back at the battle camp, they&#8217;re finishing up battle strategies; they need for the Bolton forces to come at them and not the other way around, otherwise they would be surrounded on 3 sides. Jon thinks that Ramsay&#8217;s overconfidence and arrogance will be his downfall, but Sansa knows Ramsay and she tells Jon as much. Ramsay is the one who sets traps and plays with people; he will not fall for Jon&#8217;s traps. She chides Jon for not including her in their battle preparations and reiterates that they need more men. Jon again tells her that they have to make do with what they have because they&#8217;ve asked all the people they could ask and what they have is what they have to use. For being all high and mighty about not being consulted by Jon, she sure as heck doesn&#8217;t tell him about writing to Petyr but I guess (1). she knew that he would not be happy about it but maybe he could&#8217;ve accounted for it in his plans or (2). she didn&#8217;t know for sure that the Knights of the Vale would show up. She also tells Jon that Rickon will likely not survive Ramsay and advises him to not do what Ramsay wants him to do, which Jon thinks is obvious but, as we see from his actions late, not too obvious. She warns Jon that if Ramsay wins, she will not be going to Winterfell alive. When Jon assures her that he will protect her, she says &#8220;no one can protect me, no one can protect anyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tormund and Davos discuss their mistakes in supporting their Kings, sour goat&#8217;s milk, and violent shitting. During his walk, Davos finds the half burnt remains of the wooden stag he had carved for Shireen, leading him to think/know that Shireen was burnt where he stood, but he decides to wait till after the battle to confront Melisandre. Jon visits with Melisandre and asks her to not revive him if he falls but she makes no promises.</p>

<p>The battle formations have been made and now they wait. Ramsay trots out holding a rope, the end of which holds a bound Rickon. Ramsay takes a knife and cuts the ropes off of Rickon. He asks Rickon to play a game &#8211; he is to run to Jon at the other end, as fast as he can. Rickon takes off running but Ramsay takes up a bow and arrow and starts shooting arrows at him. Jon gets on his horse and rides to meet Rickon in the middle. Ramsay keeps missing Rickon, who is running in a straight line (I know he should&#8217;ve been zig-zagging but who knows what you would do in that panicked mode). Jon is SO close to grabbing Rickon when he gets shot with an arrow through his back. Then Jon does what Sansa told him not to do: what Ramsay wants him to do which is get really mad and ride out by himself to the Bolton side. Scrambling to cover Jon, Davos deploys the cavalry. Jon&#8217;s horse gets shot down by a rain of Bolton arrows and Jon gets up to see a wall of Bolton cavalry charging towards him (which by the way, was an actual cavalry of 40 horses charging towards Kit). This is one of the moment in this battle where Jon is like &#8220;I&#8217;ve made a huge mistake&#8221; &#8211; he just takes his belt off, takes Longclaw out, and prepares to fight till his last breath. However, before he can hit anyone, his cavalry clashes with the Boltons and the battle starts.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to recap every single thing that happened in this battle because it was so much. The battle scene was beautifully done and was a cinematic masterpiece. Unlike showing battles like this as glorious and heroic, taking inspiration from accounts of battles from the American Civil War and the Battle of Agincourt, the chaos and confusion of a battle was portrayed very well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone aligncenter" src="http://cdn.bgr.com/2016/06/game-of-thrones-season-6-episode-9-sansa-littlefinger.gif?w=624" alt="" width="872" height="488" /></p>
<p>Jon knows he fucked up a 2nd time, when their army gets surrounded on 3 sides by the Boltons against a 4th side of a wall of bodies, which more Boltons climb over to fight them. The Boltons have their shields up and advance on them with their lances, forcing them into an even smaller space. This leads to panic and people trampling on others, including Jon right as he was about to fight Umber. He starts suffocating under the weight of people but finally manages to pull himself up for air. Tormund is getting beat by Umber, when a horn sounds in the distance. As Umber is distracted, Tormund bites a chunk of his neck off and stabs him in the face. The horn is from the Knights of the Vale, who straight crush the Bolton army. Jon, along with Wun Wun and Tormund, climbs over the wall of bodies and goes after Ramsay, who turns and heads back inside the gates of Winterfell. He thinks he is safe but that is because he doesn&#8217;t know how much of a badass Wun Wun is &#8211; he fucking breaks down the doors of Winterfell, while being shot by a bazillion arrows.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-39043 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/jon-snow-is-boss-300x200.jpg" alt="jon-snow-is-boss" width="797" height="532" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/jon-snow-is-boss-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/jon-snow-is-boss-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/jon-snow-is-boss-1200x800.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/jon-snow-is-boss-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/jon-snow-is-boss-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/jon-snow-is-boss.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px" /></p>
<p>Ramsay shoots Wun Wun through the eye and then tells Jon that he&#8217;s down for fighting one on one. Before he can get an arrow off, Jon grabs a Mormont shield and block 3 arrows while walking right to Ramsay. Jon hits Ramsay across the face with the shield, which known Ramsay down, and then just punches him in the face over and over again (Ramsay seems to be taking a little joy out of this, which, of course he would). He only stops when he sees Sansa.</p>

<p>They take the Bolton banners down and unfurl the Direwolves of Stark over Winterfell &#8211; the most beautiful sight I have ever seen my entire life. Davos has not forgotten about Shireen yet &#8211; he&#8217;s just waiting for the appropriate time. Jon instructs Rickon to be buried in the crypt, next to Ned.</p>
<div style="width: 836px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LjPO8DX-O6pRwZFM5QUMg9xHB5Q=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6677469/ramsay_dogs.0.gif" alt="" width="826" height="417" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dogs can sense fear, my dude.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sansa then asks Jon where Ramsay is &#8211; then we see Ramsay wake up in the kennels. He still tries to mess with her more and that he is a part of her (is he implying she is preggo?) but she tells him: &#8220;your words will disappear, your House will disappear, your name will disappear, all memories of you will disappear.&#8221; Right at that moment, his cute as cuss puppers walk out of their kennels. Ramsay is adamant that his dogs will not harm him but Sansa reminds him that he hasn&#8217;t fed them in 7 days. They were loyal, but now they&#8217;re starving. He tries to command them to sit and get down but one of them licks his face and chomps on it. Sansa walks away with a little smile on her face as Ramsay gets torn apart by his dogs in the background.</p>

<p>I really want to call this the greatest episode in Game of Thrones history, and for some that is completely the case. Watching this episode in basically a theater with 60 of your best friends was an experience that can&#8217;t be replicated.</p>
<p>We had so much pay off this week its crazy and out of character for Game of Thrones. Dany finally comes into her own and we have an amazing stand off with the slave masters. Jon and Sansa finally kill the crap out of Ramsey, whats not to love.</p>
<p>And then there is the production quality. And the cinematography, the best they&#8217;ve ever done. The battle is frantic and beautiful. I forgot I was watching TV. Yes, we nitpick some of the writing and poor decisions of the characters, but it was an amazing ride.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first round of Rebirth comics have hit our shelves well and truly this week, along with a few of the latest from Vertigo and Image. Time to take a look in this comics round up!</p>
<h2><img class="size-large wp-image-38999 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/survivors-club-780x1200.jpg" alt="survivors club" width="620" height="954" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/survivors-club-780x1200.jpg 780w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/survivors-club-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/survivors-club-768x1182.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/survivors-club-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/survivors-club-620x954.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/survivors-club.jpg 832w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></h2>
<h2><em>Survivors Club #9 (Vertigo)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Lauren Beukes and Dale Halvorsen<br />
Pencils: Ryan Kelly</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions:</strong></h3>
<p>Bill Sienkiewicz has knocked the cover out of the park yet again with a gothic style vignette. By the looks of things we’ll be getting a little more of Nena, which is excellent as, wait, hang on. Final issue? No damn way. Well now I guess that just goes to show you, just because you’re enjoying something does not mean its selling well enough. I’m very sad to <em>Survivors Club </em>go. I feel like it was recently hitting a good stride and had some great places to go in terms of story. I’m quite worried that we’ll end up with a rushed ending and all the careful narrative planning will come to a sudden, and unsatisfying, head. I guess there’s no point in worrying about, may as well strap in and enjoy the ride.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict: </strong></h3>
<p>Sudden, rushed and ultimately unsatisfying; Lauren Beukes and Dale Halvorsen can’t save <em>Survivors Club </em>was narratively exploding and never coming back together. Instead of taking a silent bow out and having the Muskagee House story line end well, they instead pull back the curtain as to why our heroes are connected. Unlike the other back stories in the series, it’s done abruptly and with little warning, making the secret cult connecting them feel cheap and unthreatening. The dialogue and characters are well written, the issue isn’t unenjoyable to read, it’s just a massive let down compared to what’s come before.</p>
<p>Perhaps it wouldn’t be so bad if the very end of the issue was more aware of the concept of ‘final issue’. Instead of wrapping things up somewhat neatly leaving a couple of questions unanswered, Beukes and Halvorsen go one step too far. The cult connection between our heroes is revealed, Muskagee House, Mr Empty and Alice are all wrapped up and settled to a degree. However, the denouement doesn’t so much leave a couple of questions unanswered, as it seems to lay some ground work for another entire lot of issues. If there’s going to be more <em>Survivors Club</em>, all is forgiven, as it stands this issue is a disappointing finale to an otherwise solid series.</p>

<h2><em>Moon Knight #3 (Marvel)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Jeff Lemire<br />
Pencils: Greg Smallwood</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h3>
<p><em>Moon Knight </em>has been really solid these past two issues. It’s a twisty, turny tale that, until now, has been firmly rooted in whether our main character is really who he says he is. Given the events of the last issue, it would seem that it really doesn’t matter if Marc Spector is Moon Knight or not, he firmly believes he is. After pulling a stunning escape from the asylum, Marc and his new friends find themselves trapped in a subway tunnel with, of course, a handle of mummies. Till now, <em>Moon Knight </em>has been very introspective. Fantastic, but not incredibly action orientated. I’ll be interested to see how it handles what will no doubt be a good old fashioned mummy punch up.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict:</strong></h3>
<p>Solid, but just not as solid as the first two. Which is still high praise — the first two issues of <em>Moon Knight </em>were incredibly fantastic. This month, Marc and friends fight off the mummies, fight of the jackal headed nurses from the asylum, and escape on the barge of Anubis. There is of course still the whole question as to whether any of this is real. But after emerging from the subway to a New York dominated by a pyramid, that question seems to have been put to rest. Jeff Lemire and Greg Smallwood do a fine job with the fight against the mummies and the orderlies with the action flowing smoothly and Smallwood’s art having real punch behind it. It, and the chase scene afterwards, have a real comic book feel and aesthetic in the best way. It’s fun and exciting. Equally as good is the doubt that Marc Spector still feels and his conversation with Kushu. Despite all he’s been through, Marc still doubts himself and it’s nice to have a brief character driven moment in the middle of what is essentially an issue long chase scene. This is somewhat where the issue falls slightly compared to the first two. Perhaps its just where the story is right now, but this issue of <em>Moon Knight </em>just didn’t feel as creative or as interesting as the previous two. There was little panel variation and it was (disappointingly) artistically consistent the whole way through. Keep in mind however that this was <em>still</em> a stellar issue and I’m very much looking forward to the next chapter.</p>

<h2><em>Paper Girls #6 (Image)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Brian K. Vaughn<br />
</em><em>Pencils: Cliff Chiang</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions:</strong></h3>
<p>I’m incredibly excited to see Brian K. Vaughn’s 80’s tinged, time-travel, sci-fi mystery adventure make a return. It’s just so damn refreshingly odd. After our heroes were flung forward in time (apparently) after escaping the clutches of a dinosaur-commanding old man hunting down cyborg teenagers, I’m obviously very curious where this is all going. A stellar first 5 issues set up all this madness, so it’ll be interesting to see where Vaughn takes it and whether that quirky quality that typified that last 5 will still be present. Or, will there be a tonal shift? Are we in for some new rollercoaster ride? Either way, I’m expecting big things.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict: </strong></h3>
<p>Honestly, doesn’t hold a candle to the previous 5, but is still a great precursor for the next story arc. The titular Paper Girls meet up with Erin’s future counterpart and what follows is a bit of a re-hash of the whole “I’m you from the past” trope. Vaughn’s writing is top-notch enough that it’s still enjoyable, but it’s a little cliché for a series that has so far been so original. In fact, nothing really happens in this issue with our heroes other than they go back to Future-Erin’s house and then decide to go into the city to investigate something more interesting. It is instead the brief glimpses of ‘Grandfather’ (the time travelling old man) and yet another version of Erin that are truly interesting and hint at Vaughn having a genuine overarching plan. Chiang’s art is gorgeous as always, but I feel like he didn’t get a whole lot to play with this issue. In fact, I get the impression that neither had much to play with. A highly enjoyable issue, but not as stand out as what’s come before.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-37676 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Batman-Rebirth.jpg" alt="Batman: Rebirth- On Sale June First" width="600" height="923" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Batman-Rebirth.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Batman-Rebirth-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Batman-Rebirth-298x458.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2><em>Batman: Rebirth #1</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Tom King<br />
Artist: Mikel Janin</em></p>
<h2><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h2>
<p>I’ve already pretty extensively talked about <em>Batman: Rebirth</em>, so I won’t repeat myself too much here. If you didn’t catch the article, basically, <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/dc-rebirth-run-down-batman/">I’m super excited</a>. Tom King is a fantastic writer with a huge list of critically acclaimed titles behind him. On top of that, <em>DC Rebirth</em> <em>#1</em> was excellent, and <em>Batman: Rebirth</em> is the first Rebirth title I’m picking up. Expectations are high.</p>
<h2><strong>Verdict: </strong></h2>
<p>Expectations, frankly, were not met. <em>Batman: Rebirth</em> was a good Batman comic, but didn’t really give me any kind of a sense of rebirth or even set up the next story arc. I mean this in the best possible way, but almost nothing happened. Batman teams up with a new Robin (sort of) and foils a scheme from the new Calendar Man. King’s interpretation of Calendar Man is notable, and I really hope he’ll be making a return. But again, this is kind of the meat of the issue. There’s no rumination on Batman himself, no analysis of his place in Gotham, nothing to suggest that this is actually a Batman rebirth. There is a brief nod to it at the very end where Bruce says that they’ll just have to come back better every time, though this is hardly what I was expecting. The issue isn’t unenjoyable, King is a good writer, but overall it just feels like filler before we get to the actual series.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-39005 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/green-lanterns.jpg" alt="green lanterns" width="640" height="984" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/green-lanterns.jpg 640w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/green-lanterns-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/green-lanterns-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/green-lanterns-620x953.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2><em>Green Lanterns: Rebirth #1</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Sam Humphries and Geoff Johns<br />
Pencils: Ethan Van Sciver</em></p>
<h3><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h3>
<p>Again, like <em>Batman</em>, <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/dc-rebirth-rundown-justice-league/">I’ve been here before</a>. Sam Humphires has a few good pieces behind him, but some inconsistent ones too. I’m also a little cautious around the idea of Jessica Cruz and Simon Baz becoming the buddy-cop duo for Green Lantern. It could go excellently, it could also fall totally flat. I’m quietly hopeful.</p>
<h3><strong>Verdict: </strong></h3>
<p>A little more what I was expecting from Rebirth. At its heart, <em>Green Lanterns: Rebirth</em> is essentially a 20 page excuse as to why Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz would possibly team up. The long and short being because Hal Jordan forces them to. There was one thing that really stood out to while reading this. Humphries has made pains to actually give Simon and Jessica distinct voices and personalities. My worry was that both characters would sound ‘heroic’. Tough, strong, and unwavering in the face of such a responsibility as being a Green Lantern. But they don’t. Simon accepts its grudgingly and Jessica is understandably freaked about the whole thing. It gives me great hope that when the series kicks off in earnest that there’s going to be a real buddy-cop type dynamic between Jessica and Simon. Ethan Van Sciver is of course in fine form on art duties and I greatly look forward to his work in the future. I do have to mention the few pages in the middle as being a little less than average and I really hope they won’t be making a return. A fairly solid reintroduction to the Green Lantern universe and a good leap off point for a new series.</p>

<p>The Abridged Drunks and Dragons is our attempt to making getting into the DnD Podcast easier for new listeners. Episodes have been boiled down to around 10 &#8211; 20 minutes. All the important story bits, and even more important goofs and tangents have been left in for your enjoyment.</p>
<p>This original version of this episode is <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/drunks-and-dragons-episode-32-i-hate-gnolls/">Drunks and Dragons Episode 32</a>.</p>
<h5>Synopsis from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Drunks_and_Dragons_Episodes">Drunks and Dragons Wiki</a>:</h5>
<blockquote><p>Despite the pain of <a title="Tum &quot;Darkblade&quot; Thumble" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tum_%22Darkblade%22_Thumble">Tum</a>&#8216;s death and <a title="Junpei Iori" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Junpei_Iori">Junpei</a>&#8216;s departure being fresh, <a title="Ros" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Ros">Ros</a> is ever the businesswoman and needs the party&#8217;s approval on some new hires. They weed through the chaf and eventually decide on <a title="Winston" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Winston">Winston</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Lord Titus Harper" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lord_Titus_Harper">Harper</a>. Winston because he is burly and strong. Harper because he almost simultaneously melts Ros and Aludra&#8217;s panties off with his good looks. The party also meets <a title="Bucky" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Bucky">Bucky</a>, a plucky Githyanki orphan.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tara: Last year on our way to GeeklyCon I got kind of obsessed with board game apps. We had a couple of crazy layovers so it really helped to pass the time. Before I had even really met any of the other Geeklyinc contributors I asked the chat if anyone would want to play online with us. Bijaya enthusiastically agreed to join our game of Lords of Waterdeep. And for a complete newbie to board games, she was pretty damn good! This year for GeeklyCon travels, we want to continue the tradition! Make some new friends in the community and play some board games online while everyone is traveling to Portland this year! Feel free to leave your username in the comments below. If you’re flying, splurge for that airplane wi-fi and enjoy the ride. You’ve earned it.</p>

<p>Phil: Much of my free time has been dedicated to playing <i>Patchwork</i>. A game about creating a quilt from mismatched patches of fabric and trying to get the least amount of holes in your quilt. While the theme is not fantastic the gameplay really makes up for it. You will be trying to fit the rejected Tetris pieces into a 9&#215;9 area. <i>Patchwork</i> wonderful game to pass and play, battle the AI or even play online against friends. I cannot recommend this game enough.</p>

<p>Tara: One of my favorite games to play online with friends. Set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe, this game is a great introduction to the worker placement genre. The animation and artwork is top notch. Make sure you sign up for a Playdek account so you can play online!</p>

<p>Tara: Another quick and fun euro game from Days of Wonder. I steered away from this one for a long time because I thought the hype around it was too big. I completely regret it now. This can be a pretty fast one too! Bonus points for whoever makes the longest line of trains on the map!</p>

<p>Deckbuilding is a really fun and accessible genre for those new to the board game scene. <i>Star Realms</i> is possibly the best deck builder to begin your journey. The campaign is great about getting you used to the game and teaching some advanced strategy while still offering a challenge. The online portion works smoothly allowing you to play against friends or in ranked play.</p>

<p>Phil: Bring all the nobles to the yard by collecting gems in <i>Splendor.</i> A game about creating a gem empire. You will begin with hoble small mines and eventually build up to large storefronts in major metropolis. Each building acquired will provide you with a gem type giving you a static amount of gems to further advance your empire. While this version is for single player only the challenges and achievement hunting is rewarding.</p>

<p>iOS</p>
<p>$6.99</p>
<p>1-5 players</p>
<p>Michael: This game may have one of the most punishing AIs out of any of the games we have listed here. Still, look no further if you’re seeking a really robust game at your fingertips. You’ll have your own farm and trade in town for the supplies you need to grow and manage your crops, feed your cattle, and build your home. And no, this is not Farmville.</p>

<p>iOS/Android</p>
<p>Free or $9.99</p>
<p>2-10 players</p>
<p>Michael: It’s only fair to warn everyone that this game can take over a week to play. It can be brutal, and if you make any friends at GeeklyCon, this is the perfect way to lose them. Each player is racing to gather resources that they’ll mine using drills on islands at sea. Players can battle using submarines and special units that can change the outcome of a battle, and planning takes place hours in advance. For people with a diplomatic abilities and a strategic mind, this game may be perfect.</p>

<p>On this episode of Penny Dreadful, we see some things that collective make us all let out the sails and sail out to sea in our &#8220;ship&#8221; ship. Our lovely Lyle comes back, only to break our hearts, Vanessa gets a new lady friend that we swoon over, and Ethan finishes dying his Edgelord hair black and sits down for what might be the most awkward family dinner. We also get into Dorian and Lily&#8217;s prostitute army and how Justine isn&#8217;t just lusty for blood, she&#8217;s down right cray.</p>
<p>This week we are joined by hosts Brad Brockway (@bsquared_yo), Nika Howard (@nika_howard), and you guys asked and she is back!-Kym Stonick (@kymcattys).</p>

<p>This has to be one of the best episodes so far. It may not be the most exciting episode, but every segment this weeks was incredibly solid and they took the time to let the scenes breathe. This episode was the calm before the storm and the end is coming, and it will be glorious. Jamie is back on track with book Jamie, Cersei is getting all kinds of burns, Margery isn&#8217;t just a puppet. John and Sansa are working together and little lady Mormont is adorable. And finally, Arya, she had a very short but exciting ark this week. Our prayers are with you fictional character.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Guess who&#8217;s back, back again (part deux)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This recap obviously contains spoilers from Season 6 Episode 7.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38906 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BN-OI498_hound_J_20160605220631-300x200.jpg" alt="BN-OI498_hound_J_20160605220631" width="773" height="515" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BN-OI498_hound_J_20160605220631-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BN-OI498_hound_J_20160605220631-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BN-OI498_hound_J_20160605220631-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BN-OI498_hound_J_20160605220631-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BN-OI498_hound_J_20160605220631.jpg 959w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A bunch of people are hanging out, building stuff, cooking stuff, and carrying stuff. But wait, that tall dude is carrying a whole tree by his dang self! Who is this strong, tall man? ITS THE HOUND! If you remember, the Hound lost the fight with Brienne and was left to die by Arya at the end of season 4. Apparently, Septon Ray came across the Hound, who appeared to be dead, while traveling with his flock &#8211; only the Hound wasn&#8217;t dead. They tried to get him better and feared he would die a dozen more times but the Hound survived and is now doing pretty well. The Hound tells the Septon that he survived because of hate &#8211; he&#8217;s got some real strong ass hate in his heart that kept him from dying. The Septon tells the Hound that he has clearly been given a second chance for a reason. When the Hound asks why was given his chance and not punished for the things he did in his past, the Septon says he&#8217;s already been punished. Dude, remember when you were almost dead and had maggots and crap crawling on you? I&#8217;m pretty sure you can chalk that up as punishment. This Septon also seems different than the High Sparrow in that he doesn&#8217;t talk about religion and God as though he knows everything &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t know which gods are the right one. The only thing he knows is that there is a higher power.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38907" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6070004-300x200.jpg" alt="got6070004" width="787" height="524" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6070004-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6070004-768x511.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6070004-298x198.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6070004-620x412.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6070004.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Later, while the Septon is preaching about how violence is a plague that spread between people and that it is never too late to change oneself, the group is visited by men from the Brotherhood without Banners, and they inquire about food, gold, and iron. When the Septon tells them they don&#8217;t have iron or gold but they can share the food, the men leave after telling them to stay safe because &#8220;the night is dark and full of terrors&#8221;. With the Septon refusing to take up arms against what is clearly a threat, the group goes about their business. Sandor is chopping more wood in the woods when he hears a distance scream. When he gets to where his group was, he finds them all slaughtered and the Septon hung. Sandor grabs his ax and he&#8217;s probably going to kill him some dudes. The Hound is baaaaaaaaack. He is no longer broken.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Margaery is reading the Good Book, this time a verse about mothers. The High Sparrow compliments her on her knowledge and ability to learn quickly. She reiterates how she used to pretend to love and help the poor when in reality, she merely pitied them and was disgusted by them. The High Sparrow gets it; he says we are disgusted by them because the poor are ourselves without the fine clothes and the perfume. He also inquires after a private matter: why hasn&#8217;t she been boning Tommen since she&#8217;s been out &#8211; she has a duty as a Queen and a wife. She tells him that she is no longer driven by the desires as she was in the past and he tells her that &#8220;congress does not require desire on the woman&#8217;s part, only patience&#8221;. In other words, she doesn&#8217;t need to <em>want</em> to have sex &#8211; just needs to be <em>patient enough</em> to let him finish because she needs to make an heir. Oh okay, cool. Also, their vibe was kind of weird &#8211; dare I say, sexually tense? &#8211; but maybe I&#8217;m just reading it wrong. As a parting word of advice, he says that he hopes that Olenna follows her path before something bad happens to her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38908" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6704-300x200.jpg" alt="got6704" width="806" height="537" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6704-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6704-768x511.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6704-1200x799.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6704-298x198.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6704-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6704.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Marg goes to see Olenna, with Septa Unella in tow. Olenna wants to speak with her granddaughter alone but Unella is ever present. She tries to move to another room (open and adjacent to the first one) but Ulenna only follows suit. She tries to threaten Unella but to no avail. She cannot understand what has happened to her granddaughter and why she is in line with the High Sparrow. Olenna wants Marg to leave but Marg isn&#8217;t budging; instead, she tells Olenna that she needs to go. Kneeling down to hold her hand, Marg slips a piece of paper in Olenna&#8217;s hand whilst insisting that she go home &#8211; her eyes tell Olenna that it is imperative she go home. She finally relents and leaves the room. When out of the room, she opens the parchment Marg pressed in her hand &#8211; it is a rose, the sigil of House Tyrell and it lets her know that Marg isn&#8217;t gone from them after all. Side note: I wonder if Unella thought it was weird that Olenna suddenly relented when she had been so steadfast on not going home the whole time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38909" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6.7cersei.0-300x200.jpg" alt="got6.7cersei.0" width="785" height="523" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6.7cersei.0-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6.7cersei.0-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6.7cersei.0-1200x800.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6.7cersei.0-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6.7cersei.0-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6.7cersei.0.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cersei visits Olenna and bid her adieu but Olenna wants none of her shit. She reminds Cersei that basically everything that is going on in the city is her fault. Cersei admits to as much but also proposes to fight the fight together. Olenna is like &#8220;girl, look, you are like one of the worst people I have ever met in my whole long life.&#8221; She has not forgotten how Cersei smirked when Loras and Marg were dragged into the cells and she&#8217;s not down to clown with Cersei. She&#8217;s leaving King&#8217;s Landing and advises that Cersei do the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the North, Jon and Tormund are trying to convince the wildlings to join them. The wildlings don&#8217;t want to join them because its not their fight &#8211; they won&#8217;t be fighting against the white walkers. Jon gets it but at the same time, he explains to them that if he loses to the Boltons, the Boltons will come kill all the wildlings, so if they want to live long enough to face the white walkers, they need to help him defeat the Boltons. Tormund adds that Jon died for them and if they&#8217;re not willing to do the same for him, they are cowards and they should be the last of the Freefolks. You know who is down for Jon? Wun Wun. Then the other wildlings also agree to join.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38910 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6070002-300x169.jpg" alt="got6070002" width="770" height="434" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6070002-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6070002-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6070002-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6070002-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6070002.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They go to Bear Island and get an audience with hard ass Lyanna Mormont. She is unmoved by the words of Sansa and Jon and boy does she put them through the ringer. She doesn&#8217;t care about growing up to be beautiful. Jon is a Snow and Sansa is a Bolton or a Lannister. She has to look after the people of Bear Island and why should she sacrifice more people to fight &#8220;Stark&#8221; wars? She so sassy and strong. Davos steps up and tells her that the North needs to be united if they are going to fight the Night King, because the white walkers are coming. She likes what Davos has to say and relents saying House Mormont will not break from House Stark and pledges a whopping 62 men. This made me think about the <em>Lord of the Rings: Two Towers </em>movie, when the Elves came to join the Men for the Battle of Helm&#8217;s Deep.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-38911 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GOT607_121115_HS__DSC3884_1_.0-300x200.jpg" alt="GOT607_121115_HS__DSC3884_1_.0" width="738" height="492" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GOT607_121115_HS__DSC3884_1_.0-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GOT607_121115_HS__DSC3884_1_.0-768x511.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GOT607_121115_HS__DSC3884_1_.0-298x198.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GOT607_121115_HS__DSC3884_1_.0-620x412.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GOT607_121115_HS__DSC3884_1_.0.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They also visit House Glover but are not as lucky. Lord Glover lost a lot during Robb&#8217;s war and the Bolton&#8217;s helped him get his castle back, so no thanks, he will not be joining you all. Sansa&#8217;s naivete and romantic idea of house allegiance and &#8220;the North Remembers&#8221; shows again when she reminds Lord Glover that his house is pledged to help House Stark. Jon is like &#8220;ugh not this, Sansa&#8221; but Lord Glover lets her have it. Dude has lost his brother, his wife, and his kids and here&#8217;s Sansa talking about &#8220;duty&#8221; and &#8220;allegiance&#8221;. Davos was right &#8211; after a certain point, people want to protect themselves and their families and allegiances fall by the way side. They&#8217;re going to have to march on Winterfell with the small army they have but Sansa wants more men and is making fun of Davos. Lyk, serrsly Sansa? Jon is like BRO, THIS IS WHAT WE GOT, OKAY? So, Sansa writes a note and seals it with a Stark seal &#8211; is she writing to Petyr to ask for assistance from the Vale? (Lyanna Mormont is with her men, how badass is that??)</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Jaime and Bronn make it to Riverrun, where the Frey host is doing a terrible job of protecting their camp. The Lannister army straight strolls in to their camp. The two Frey sons are making a thing about threatening to kill Edmure by hanging him. When Blackfish doesn&#8217;t yield, they take the noose off and threaten to slit Edmure&#8217;s throat but Blackfish just tells them to do it and walks off. BOOOOM. Of course they don&#8217;t kill Edmure and Blackfish probably knew that, or didn&#8217;t care. Jaime criticizes their camp and takes over their siege (after humiliating Walder Frey). He orders them to bathe and feed Edmure. He meets with the Blackfish to parlay and tells him to surrender, since the war is over. Riverrun is Blackfish&#8217;s home and he wants to live protecting it or die. The Tullys have 2 years worth of provision so they&#8217;re going to stay put. The Blackfish had no intention to surrender; he just came to talk to Jaime because he was bored and because he wanted to size Jaime up &#8211; he was not impressed. Side note: I love the Tully armor &#8211; they look like fish scales.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Yara, Theon, and their men are in Volantis, hanging out in a brothel and Theon does not like it. He is so afraid of Ramsay or Euron coming after them. Yara makes Theon play a weird drinking game where she tells him she will protect him, drink; that they will get revenge, drink; and that he needs to come back from being the broken man he was to being Theon Greyjoy again, drink. He tells her that he is with her and that he will help her take the Iron Islands back. He is on his way to not being a broken man.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38914" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6706-300x169.jpg" alt="got6706" width="762" height="429" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6706-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6706-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6706-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6706-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6706-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/got6706.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Arya is in regular clothes now, strolling the streets of Braavos when she hears two Westerosi men talking about the Greyjoy fleet in Slaver&#8217;s Bay. Arya asks to buy a passage back to Westeros. The men laugh her off, saying she can&#8217;t afford it and she clunks down a pouch of coins. The man offers her a hammock in steerage, so she plunks down another pouch of coins, telling him that she will have a cabin and they will leave at dawn. She is looking out at the Titan of Braavos, when an old lady calls out to her. When she turns to face the old lady, she swings a knife at Arya, holds her, and stabs her multiple times, including twisting the knife whilst inside Arya. She takes her face off, revealing herself to be the Waif. Arya headbutts her, leaps off the bridge and into the water below. The waif watches for Arya to resurface but she doesn&#8217;t. Arya does resurfaces further down the waterway. She walks the streets of Braavos, bleeding from her stomach and in sight of everyone but no one stops to help her. Not a good episode for Starks.</p>

<blockquote><p>The party arrives at <a title="Bowbreaker Bay" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Bowbreaker_Bay">Bowbreaker Bay</a> and starts asking around about <a title="The Lost Island" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=The_Lost_Island">The Lost Island</a>. A bartender tells them about a Githyanki with an <a title="Unspellable Japanesey Githyanki name" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Unspellable_Japanesey_Githyanki_name">Unspellable Japanesey Githyanki name</a> and the party goes to talk to him. Reasonable talk all goes out the window when they burst into his house and immediately go off on a tangent about something else. <a title="Unspellable Japanesey Githyanki name" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Unspellable_Japanesey_Githyanki_name">Unspellable Japanesey Githyanki name</a> is a frail old man and runs in terror from the maniacs invading his house.<a title="Junpei Iori" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Junpei_Iori">Junpei Iori</a> fires off a Thunder Wave to stop him but forgets to declare non-lethal damage and straight up murders him in the street. It takes the party a considerate amount of time to realize that they just murdered someone in the street and maybe that&#8217;s not such a good thing.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s safe to say that, over the last few years, superhero films have seen something of a rise. That is of course easily one of the largest understatements I have ever made, or really that anyone has ever made. Some of these films are comic-book charged vehicles to place a not so subtle mirror against American politics or other societal issues. Some of them are not. This is hardly a bad thing; there’s nothing wrong with a film being fun just for the sake of being fun. Sadly, <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> is neither a piece of societal introspection, or particularly fun.</p>
<p>Coming hot off the heels of the excellent, time-travelling <em>Days of Future Past</em>, <em>Apocalypse</em> always had quite difficult shoes to fill. The film opens with a sequence within which Apocalypse, ruling over ancient Egypt, transfers his mind into a younger body. The entire thing is, admittedly, very well put together and quite entertaining. It is however incredibly bombastic and melodramatic. If the film is to be believed, this scene is perhaps the most important scene in not only this movie, but every movie ever made. And it really sets the tone for the rest of the film. This is, immediately, <em>Apocalypse</em>’s biggest fault. It takes itself far, far too seriously. With the exception of a few jokes scattered about in the films weighty two and a half hour running, every line is weighed down by drama and self-importance. <em>Days of Future Past </em>and <em>First Class</em> were hardly comedic films, but there was certain lightness to them, a hopeful air and casual nature that is severely lacking from <em>Apocalypse</em>.</p>
<p>None of the performances in the movie can be faulted too greatly, and <em>Apocalypse </em>does have to be celebrated for giving us a version of Cyclops that isn’t incredibly lame. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender do a predictably fine turn as Professor X and Magneto. Both actors are excellent in every scene they play, however at times even they seem to be struggling with the syrupy dialogue. Oscar Issac is in full melodrama mode as the titular villain and the sheer amount of energy he brings to the role has to be heartily congratulated. While another actor may have shied away from the silly spectacle of a body-swapping mutant attempting to remake the world, Issac instead embraces the entire idea with gusto. His performance is full of life and enjoyable, but no less overly serious.</p>
<p><em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> is by no means a bad film. I was not angry or sad that I had seen it, and I still walked away having enjoyed big chunks of it. I was however disappointed, in that I thought it could have been so much better. The film was far too serious for what it was, and it was far too overstuffed for what was supposed to be serious to have any kind of impact. An enjoyable throw away afternoon at the movies, but not an afternoon I’m rushing to repeat.</p>

And that means we&#8217;ll be sitting down to have a look through their pages and sort out whats what. The highlight this week is of course, the much awaited <em>DC Universe: Rebirth</em>, but first up, the penultimate chapter of <em>Edge of Oblivion</em>.</p>
<h2><img class="size-large wp-image-38785 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/glc-5-780x1200.jpg" alt="glc 5" width="620" height="954" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/glc-5-780x1200.jpg 780w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/glc-5-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/glc-5-768x1181.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/glc-5-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/glc-5-620x953.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/glc-5.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></h2>
<h2><em>Green Lantern Corps: Edge of Oblivion #5 (DC Comics)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Tom Taylor<br />
Pencils: Adrian Syaf</em></p>
<h4><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h4>
<p>This thing has been uneven to the max from day one. The previous issue may have had a little bit of punch that earlier issues lacked, but it’s just not enough to make up for the whole series being a bit weak. Potentially it’s because this is the week of <em>DC Universe: Rebirth</em> and in the grand scheme, none of this matters. The stakes have certainly been raised with the Green Lanterns seemingly poised to do battle with Asuras and Dismas on the last inhabited world of this universe. And if that wasn’t quite enough, the universe is about end.</p>
<p>The cover for this month does not make me particularly hopeful. The idea of lanterns fighting lanterns is tired. It needs to be tucked in, sung a song and put to bed at this point. But hey, I was pleasantly surprised last issue with something that wasn’t awful; maybe lightning does indeed strike twice?</p>
<h4><strong>Verdict: </strong></h4>
<p>Pleasantly Surprised 2: Electric Boogaloo. Maybe it was the fact that Taylor gave more time for character, had more exciting action sequences, or perhaps he held his tongue in the right place; but I actually quite enjoyed this one. Guy is quickly subdued after coming under the control of Asuras and Dismas, and a plan against the two world-eaters is formed. With the rest of the lanterns under their control, it all looks rather bleak until the oft hinted at Iolande comes to the rescue with the rest of the corps.</p>
<p>The biggest hint that this issue was better than the ones that came before it, is that when I arrived at the end, I was actually slightly disappointed. I wanted to know how Mogo would help the corps defeat Asuras and Dismas. I had a genuine desire to find out what happened in the end. Thankfully, a very small part of the issue was devoted to the corps infighting; instead we were given an unfolding of their master plan to take down Asuras and Dismas. There was even a small piece of character building with Guy Gardner determined to take the hits for the corps, much in the same way he did for his mother when his father had a little too much to drink. It’s nice and serves to give a little bit more of a connection to Guy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while this is all good and Adrian Syaf’s art is excellent, it feels too little too late. If the next issue is anything like this, the ending will be strong, but let down by a very weak beginning.</p>

<h2><em>Clean Room #8 (Vertigo)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Gail Simone<br />
Pencils: John Davis-Hunt</em></p>
<h4><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h4>
<p>After a rollercoaster first 6 issues, we took a bit of time last month to get to know Astrid Mueller. Self-help guru, corporate overlord and apparently, gifted with the ability to see aliens. Or something. After narrowly averting disaster in issue #6 and all but confirming that Astrid’s various power plays are nothing more than a means to protect the planet, I’m curious to see where this all goes.</p>
<p>If the cover is any indication, we’re set to learn even more about Astrid this week, which is great. She’s rather quickly and mercilessly come to the fore as the second main character alongside Chloe, so more information about her is always welcome. But I can’t help but feel sorry for Chloe. She’s just not as interesting as Astrid, and lately hasn’t had a whole lot to do. With her teaming up with Detective Avil Demakos, perhaps that’ll change sometime soon?</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: </strong></p>
<p>Hot damn, what a cracker. I don’t normally say this, but if you are a reader of <em>Clean Room</em> and haven’t read this latest issue, then get right to it. It’s got such a twist and a stellar opening; I don’t want to ruin it. Read it? Great. So, how about that opener?</p>
<p>Having Astrid completely taken out of the game after building her up like she did is a genius move on Simone’s part. It shakes the whole story up without being corny and really helps put the focus back on Chloe, while no doubt kicking off our next story arc. What I particularly enjoyed was the way Astrid begins this issue in a position of power, giving one of her famous talks, before being so quickly gunned down. It makes the moment so much more powerful as, until now, we’ve always seen Astrid in that position of power. And of course, Chloe’s power play of bringing Spark into the Clean Room is sure to develop into something quite fantastic.</p>
<p>Jon Davis-Hunt’s art is up there with the story as well. It’s clear, crisp and excellently executed. There’s an obvious care taken here, and it’s a real pleasure to read. The real highlight of course is Spark half tearing his way out of his human body; Davis-Hunt’s talent for disturbing body-horror is on full display. <em>Clean Room</em> has honestly jumped from strength to strength, and this issue is a particularly strong one.</p>

<h2><em>Justice League #50 (Darkseid War Part 10)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: GeoffJohns<br />
Pencils: Jason Fabok</em></p>
<h4><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h4>
<p>I’m excited. I’m very, very excited. I enjoy comic books as a medium for visually and literarily exploring ideas. Equally, I enjoy them as a way to see really cool shit happen and go “wow, that was cool”. So, I’m excited. <em>Darkseid War </em>has been several months in the telling and, while the last issue was something of a jumble, Geoff Johns does write fairly solid conclusions to his events. And with a double sized issue this month, he’s got plenty of room to do so. Considering what’s happened before, he needs the extra space.</p>
<p>With Darkseid dead at the hands of the universe destroying Anti-Monitor, the Justice League, infused with his energy and turned into gods, Ultrawoman (from Earth 3 no less) having just given birth and Darkseid’s daughter Grail arriving back on Earth with a super-powered Steve Trevor — there are a hell of a lot of threads to tie up here. I’m incredibly curious to see how the whole thing plays out, especially considering that this is the issue that leads straight into <em>DC Universe: Rebirth</em>. High stakes, and high hopes.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: </strong></p>
<p>Unlike last month’s issue, there was a good sense of coherence this time round and the action was very easy to follow. And there was, let’s be honest, quite a lot of it. Too much, even, to recap. Needless to say, our heroes were eventually victorious. I particularly enjoyed the (somewhat ridiculous) way that Johns ramped the action up every few pages, unveiling yet another, larger threat for the league to contend with. Yes it felt a little silly, but John’s treats the material with such an earnest feeling that you can’t help but gasp to yourself as Ultrawomans glowing baby absorbs a variety of power and turns into Darkseid.</p>
<p>Complimenting this is Jason Fabok’s art which is, per usual, stellar and very pleasant to look at. He seems to be having a total ball on this issue with some of the series biggest and flashiest action scenes and splashes. Seriously, Fabok is an artist to keep an eye out for; whatever he does is bound to be outstanding. The entire package is great; lines, colors and inks.</p>
<p>Overall, a spectacularly epic conclusion to a spectacularly epic, and ambitious, story. Geoff Johns does what I genuinely doubted he could and brings the entire <em>Darkseid War </em>saga to a satisfying, confusing, and bombastic close that alters the DC Universe for the near future and leaves me with 1,000 questions.</p>

<h2><em>DC Universe: Rebirth #1 (DC Comics)</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: GeoffJohns<br />
Pencils: A Variety of Geoff John’s Closest Friends</em></p>
<h4><strong>First Impressions: </strong></h4>
<p>The previews look good (the few I’ve looked at), initial review are positive, and DC themselves are positive. I admit freely, I’ve given into the hype. I’ve not been this excited to read an issue of a comic for several years. I feel like I’m about to read something genuinely very exciting that will make me excited to read DC all over again. I can’t even use this space to speculate on the plot. Yes, I am aware that details of it have been revealed and teased for months, but I’ve stayed away. I want a fresh experience. And now, I can’t wait any longer.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: </strong></p>
<p>I’ll keep this verdict short as the story is too excellent to really spoil. <em>DC Universe: Rebirth</em> is everything I had hoped for. It acknowledges the somewhat dour tone of the New 52, concedes that legacy is an important factor in telling comic book stories, and sets a hopeful tone for the rest of the universe. The New 52’s re-launch event <em>Flashpoint</em> was a total, hard reset. It felt like the New 52 was the unwelcome result of a time-related disaster. <em>Rebirth</em> feels like the first step towards not only a better future, but the future that we should have always had.</p>
<p>Comic-related pontificating aside, the issue is actually very good. It’s exciting, it’s (at times) emotional, excellently written of course, very well drawn, and above all bloody interesting. If <em>Dc Universe: Rebirth</em> is an indication of what is to come for DC over the next few years, I am incredibly excited. Not to mention that twist at the end which was the first comic page in a while make me audibly say “holy shit” to myself in a very long time. If you’re looking to jump onto DC in the wake of Rebirth, this is a great place to start.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This recap obviously contains spoilers from Season 6 Episode 6.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">  <img class=" wp-image-38828 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/blood-of-my-blood-recap-benjen-300x218.jpg" alt="blood-of-my-blood-recap-benjen" width="850" height="618" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/blood-of-my-blood-recap-benjen-300x218.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/blood-of-my-blood-recap-benjen-298x216.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/blood-of-my-blood-recap-benjen-620x450.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/blood-of-my-blood-recap-benjen.jpg 655w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Meera is trying her darndest to pull the sled with Bran on it but her energy is spent. Meanwhile, Bran is having all these visions, including his fall from the tower, the Mad King, wildfire, Jaime killing the Mad King, Ned at the Tower of Joy, dragons, battle at Hardhome, etc. (If you want a detailed breakdown of his vision, check out <a href="http://watchersonthewall.com/brans-vision-broken/">Watchers on the Wall</a>.) He also sees that the Others have tracked them and are catching up. He finally comes out of warging and tells Meera that they are fucked. They see the Others running towards them and get ready for certain death but some dude on a horse shows up and burns/busts up the first few Others. While they have a little bit of time, the horseman urges them to come with him because the rest of the Others will be catching up to them soon. He hoists Bran up and lays him across his horse, helps Meera on to his horse also, and they gallop off.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38827 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Benjen-Stark-300x200.jpg" alt="Benjen-Stark" width="778" height="518" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Benjen-Stark-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Benjen-Stark-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Benjen-Stark-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Benjen-Stark-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Benjen-Stark.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They stop for rest after they lose the Others. The horseman has hunted a rabbit and drains the blood into a cup. Meera asks him why he helped them and he says the Three Eyed Raven sent for him. The Three Eyed Raven is dead but now he lives again in Bran. The horseman a comment about how when he last saw Bran, he was a boy, climbing up things his mother told him not to climb. Guys, the horseman is Benjen Stark, Bran&#8217;s uncle and First Ranger of the Night&#8217;s Watch. He went to look for the White Walkers, who found them instead and stabbed him with a sword of ice. Before he turned into a Wight, the Children put a dragonglass into his chest and saved him. He seems to know what Bran has seen in his visions and tells him that he&#8217;s the Three Eyed Raven now. He has Bran drink the blood (gross) and tells him that the Night&#8217;s King will make his way to the Wall and when he does, Bran will be there waiting for him and he will be ready. Okay.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Sam and Gilly have made it to Horn Hill and Sam is the most nervous. He hasn&#8217;t told his family that Gilly is a wildling because Lord Tarly <em>hates</em> wildlings. Their plan is to tell his family that little Sam is Sam&#8217;s son so that his family will let Gilly stay there and help raise little Sam. At the house, they are greeted by Sam&#8217;s mother and sister, who are very nice to Gilly and genuinely glad to see Sam. His sister is to marry Simon Fossoway, who apparently has yellow teeth. Gross. Sam&#8217;s brother and father are out hunting and will be home for dinner. Sam&#8217;s sister offers to lend a dress to Gilly for dinner.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38835 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GOT_MP_091715_EP606-27521-1024x682-300x200.jpg" alt="GOT_MP_091715_EP606-27521-1024x682" width="774" height="516" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GOT_MP_091715_EP606-27521-1024x682-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GOT_MP_091715_EP606-27521-1024x682-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GOT_MP_091715_EP606-27521-1024x682-298x198.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GOT_MP_091715_EP606-27521-1024x682-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GOT_MP_091715_EP606-27521-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Gilly is all done up for dinner and apparently headed to an 80s themed prom. At dinner, Lord Tarly is so pissed that Sam is back. He seems like a loving father and a great person in general. Sam tries to make small talk about the venison they&#8217;re having for dinner and its obvious that his little brother, Dickon, is the son that Randyll Tarly actually wanted. They chat about hunting and that north of the Wall, if you don&#8217;t hunt, you don&#8217;t eat, but it&#8217;s mostly just rabbits and squirrels. He tells them that Gilly is a good hunter too, to which his sister says Randyll could learn a few things from Gilly&#8217;s father because Randyll wouldn&#8217;t let his daughters learn how to hunt. When Sam opts for a second helping of bread, Randyll&#8217;s meanness comes crashing down on Sam. John Bradley-West, who plays Sam, did a great job of portraying how scared and broken Sam feels as a result of Randyll&#8217;s abuse. Gilly tried to stick up for Sam but in the process, lets slip that she is in fact a wildling. Randyll is like &#8220;AW HELL NAW, I am not hosting no wildling up in my house&#8221;. His rudeness leads to Lady Tarly, Sam&#8217;s sister, and Gilly to leave dinner. Randyll says that Gilly can work in the kitchen and they will raise little Sam, but Sam has to leave the house at first light the very next day. Sam tries to say his goodbyes to Gilly and little Sam and walks out of Gilly&#8217;s chambers, only to walk right back in a few moments later. He is in a &#8220;fuck all this&#8221; mode and says that they belong together, wherever they go. On their way out, he also grabs Heartsbane, the family&#8217;s Valyrian steel sword. Fuck you, Randyll, you dick.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Tommen is hanging out with the High Sparrow, talking about Margaery&#8217;s upcoming walk of atonement. Tommen is worried about her safety, but the High Sparrow assuages his fears saying she will be protected and that she is more loved by the people so they will probably be gentler with her than they were with Cersei. Apparently Marg is very devoted to the gods now. The High Sparrow offers to let him see her. Tommen has missed her so much and Marg says they will be together soon and things will be better than before. She also says the High Sparrow is not the person they thought he was &#8211; he&#8217;s more&#8230;he looks at the world differently. Marg has had time to think about things; she was very good at seeming good &#8211; feeding the poor and making sure she was seen doing it. She is letting go of all the lies now. She still thinks the world of Loras but thinks that his sins obscure his purity &#8211; he also needs to atone for his sins just like everyone else.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In Braavos, Arya is watching the Purple Wedding scene of the play and she&#8217;s the only one laughing at Joffrey&#8217;s death. However, she sees that Lady Crane is a better actress than the lady playing Sansa, who is in the background, mouthing the dialogue as Lady Crane acts it out. Arya heads backstage and pours the vial of poison into Lady Crane&#8217;s rum. She is headed out when the actors file in backstage but Lady Crane recognizes her as having been in the audience the other day and asks if she paid, which Arya hadn&#8217;t. Lady Crane tells her that she also snuck in to watch the plays as a child and loved it so much that she ran off to join them. Arya compliments her on her acting and Lady Cranes tells her that she does what she can but the writing is not good. Arya advises her to change it; Cersei has just lost her son, so she wouldn&#8217;t just cry and lament. She would be angry. Lady Crane asks Arya her name (Mercy) and whether she likes pretending to be other people. Arya realizes that she shouldn&#8217;t be talking to her so she takes her leave. Inspired by the chat with Arya, Lady Crane tells her co-actors that she has ideas about the play, which pisses off the dude who wrote it. She is just about to drink the poisoned rum when Arya barges back in, knocks it out of her hand, and warns her about the other actress, saying that she wants Lady Crane dead. The Waif witnesses all of this. Arya has failed her second chance and she knows it, so she goes to fetch Needle from its hiding place. Back at the House of Black and White, Jaqen is cutting and peeling off the face of a dead person. The Waif tells him of Arya&#8217;s doings and Jaqen agrees to let the Waif kill Arya. Arya waits in her chamber, in the dark, with Needle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38830 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BN-OF822_jaimee_J_20160528215329-300x200.jpg" alt="BN-OF822_jaimee_J_20160528215329" width="782" height="521" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BN-OF822_jaimee_J_20160528215329-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BN-OF822_jaimee_J_20160528215329-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BN-OF822_jaimee_J_20160528215329-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BN-OF822_jaimee_J_20160528215329-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BN-OF822_jaimee_J_20160528215329.jpg 959w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Tyrell army marches through Kings Landing and Mase looks the silliest in his armor and plumed helmet. He makes an &#8220;inspiring&#8221; speech to his troops while Jaime waits thinking &#8220;oh for fuck&#8217;s sake&#8221;. They march to the steps of the Sept, where the High Sparrow is waiting with Marg in order to start her walk of atonement. Jaime order the High Sparrow to let Marg and Loras go or face certain death, along with all of the Faith&#8217;s Militants. At first, it doesn&#8217;t seem like the High Sparrow will back down and a slaughter is about to happen but he tells Jaime that there&#8217;s no need because the walk of atonement will not happen. Seems Marg has recruited a pretty important person to join the cult: King Tommen. I couldn&#8217;t really tell if this is Marg playing the High Sparrow or the High Sparrow playing Marg. I guess we will find out eventually.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Back at the Red Keep, Tommen releases Jaime from being a Kingsguard. He is to go to the Riverlands and deal with Brynden Blackfish on behalf of Walder Frey &#8220;because he is 400 years old&#8221;. Walder Frey is making his sons try to take Riverrun back from Brynden but he needs help. He does have Edmure Tully as leverage, though. Jaime is not cool with this and does not want to go to the Riverlands at all. He wants to pay Bronn to gather the best killers he knows and he&#8217;s going to kill everyone at the Sept. Cersei tells him to chill because if he kills the High Sparrow, he won&#8217;t survive himself. She tells him to lead the Lannister army and take back Riverrun. She doesn&#8217;t need him to be at the trial because she has the Mountain to be her champion. And then they make out a bunch.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Dany &amp;  Co. are still riding towards Meereen &#8211; they still have a week of riding to go. She&#8217;s going to need a LOT of ships to get all of her army to Westeros. She has an idea churning in her head so she tells them to wait for her return and gallops off. Seems like they wait for a while and eventually, Daario starts to ride off to look for her but then a freaking dragon comes flying overhead. IT&#8217;S DROGON AND DANY IS RIDING HIM. She tells her Dothraki army that instead of picking 3 bloodriders, she chooses them all. She&#8217;s going to ask of them more than any Khal has asked his khalasar &#8211; she wants them to ride a wooden horse across the sea to fight men who wear armor and tear down their stone houses. Man, the Dothraki are like &#8220;FUCK YEAHHHHH&#8221;. This speech is basically their Independence Day speech but if a lady riding a dragon asks you to join her club, are you really going to say no?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of Townsville! Home to an unexpected set of magical girls, the Powerpuff Girls! Okay so they aren&#8217;t magic per say, but this month, I watched <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> and I&#8217;m here to say that the spirit of magical girl is alive with them.</p>
<p>Created in 1998 by Craig McCracken and originally called <em>Whoopass Stew</em>, the show features three little girls who were created in a lab where Professor Utonium was mixing sugar, spice, and everything nice. The clumsy professor accidentally adds a fourth ingredient, a can of Whoopass (changed to Chemical X for the main show) which creates perfect little girls who also kick ass. The show&#8217;s named was changed to <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> and the rest is history. The show had the highest rated Cartoon Network premiere of all time, and found an audience amongst young girls and boys. The show aired for six seasons, there was a feature movie, countless items of merchandise, manga, and even a magical girl style anime spinoff called <em>Power Puff Girls Z</em>. 2014 saw a CGI tenth anniversary special, and this year a new reboot of <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> has started airing.</p>
<div id="attachment_38765" style="width: 565px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-38765" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/blossomz.gif" alt="I've gone on record stating I'm a sucker for a transformation sequence" width="555" height="453" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;ve gone on record stating I&#8217;m a sucker for a transformation sequence</p></div>
<p>So despite the fact that the Powerpuff Girls are technically fueled by science, and not some kind of magic animal or power, they certainly exhibit many of the classic signs of a magical girl group. Let&#8217;s start with visuals: the most obvious being their specific character design. They are just the same, but just different enough to be distinct characters, and they each have a specific color palette. Blossom (the everything nice) wears red, is typically the leader, and tries her best to upload the virtues of heroism like justice and selflessness. Buttercup (the spice) wears green and is what could accurately be called the jerk of the group. She&#8217;s much more likely to start fights and tease the other girls, particularly Bubbles. Bubbles (the sugar) wears blue, loves her stuffed octopus and is the timid and extra sweet one. The interactions between the girls provides as much fuel for conflict and story as the villains themselves. The show passes the Bechdel test with flying, laser blasting colors.</p>
<div id="attachment_38766" style="width: 721px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-38766" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ppgirls-300x198.jpg" alt="&quot;We will mess you up&quot;" width="711" height="469" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ppgirls-300x198.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ppgirls-298x197.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ppgirls.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;We will mess you up&#8221;</p></div>
<p>The world that the Powerpuff Girls inhabit also falls in line nicely with the magical girl genre. Now admittedly, a lot of this stuff is your standard action genre stuff, but they parallel nicely. The city of Townsville is populated almost exclusively by hopeless civilians who spend the majority of their time being victims of strange and convoluted plots. They also suffer from the same crippling combination of face blindness and amnesia which is so common in magical girl shows. The very first episode featured a gang of large men putting on Powerpuff Girl costumes and completely convincing everybody that they were the real deal. The villains of <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> are weekly, wacky, and always bounce back despite getting beaten by three little girls.</p>
<p>Where <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> really brings out the magical girl spirit is showing who can be a superhero. Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup are cute kindergartners who wear dresses and bows, but can also shoot lasers from their eyes and fly. One of the best things the show does is never question this core fact: they are absolutely both cute and powerful and the two are not mutually exclusive. The character of Bubbles is particularly good, as she is quite shy and non confrontational in social settings. Many of the show&#8217;s plots focus around Bubbles overcoming and channeling her fears to kick some ass. The other notable female character is Sara Bellum, one of the smartest characters, whose design is a bit&#8230;troubling. She&#8217;s only ever show from the neck down, just her literally cartoonishly hot body. It was meant to be a joke, but it was a bit of an oddball in a show that celebrated kickass girls (but not necessarily women?). Luckily, I&#8217;m not alone in being troubled by this, because the reboot went so far as to remove her from the show. Executive Producer Nick Jennings told the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-powerpuff-girls-20160401-story.html">LA Times</a> &#8220;We felt like Ms. Bellum wasn&#8217;t quite indicative of the kind of messaging we wanted to be giving out at this time, so we sort of had her move on.&#8221; The reboot has also notably added a new villain called Manboy, a hyper old school masculine villain who gets a reality check when he tries to call Buttercup &#8220;Princess&#8221;. As much as removing a female character is a bit of a downer, she was a troubling character, and the show has certainly made it&#8217;s commitment to female empowerment known.</p>
<div id="attachment_38767" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-38767" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sarabellum-300x300.jpg" alt="No room for this in 2016." width="300" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sarabellum-300x300.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sarabellum-150x150.jpg 150w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sarabellum-180x180.jpg 180w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sarabellum-75x75.jpg 75w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sarabellum-298x298.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sarabellum.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">No room for this in 2016.</p></div>
<p>At its core, the magical girl genre is about literally empowering women, and <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> certainly delivers here. It&#8217;s witty writing and design allows it to hold up over time, it never felt dated or awkward to me. Who&#8217;s to say whether the new reboot will have the lasting impact of the original, but the Powerpuff Girls are here to stay no matter what.</p>

<hr />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blindspot &#8211; Why Await Life&#8217;s End<img class="size-medium wp-image-38805 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blindspot.S01E23-300x168.jpg" alt="Blindspot.S01E23" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blindspot.S01E23-300x168.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blindspot.S01E23-298x166.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blindspot.S01E23.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
This is not what I expected at all. Certain elements were predictable, specifically the reveal about Jane (as minor as it was) and Oscar&#8217;s monologue about the larger plan. And while it might not have been obvious, Mayfair handing over the details of the grand schemes made sense. But the events of this episode didn&#8217;t feel like a season finale. Everything that happened were big and dramatic, but there was no resolution or conclusion. Even though the nature of Blindspot relies on a deep mystery, the structure of a television season finale requires some sense of answers. This episode did nothing but reveal more confusion and questions. That being said, it was an excellent episode. There was puzzle solving, good action, and surprising drama. Overall, I think that season one ended with mixed results. It proved that the procedural police drama format can be adapted to be new and interesting. It also proved that a mystery is still possible in this day and age. But to do so, the show relied on cheap tricks and twists and heavy-handed drama. It also continually added layer after layer of betrayal to the mystery. Many of these elements were simply there for the sake of stretching out the story to last an entire season. The show also utilized the &#8220;X of the week&#8221; concept to an extreme. I enjoyed <em>Blindspot</em>. It was unique and exciting. And it certainly hooked my interest for whatever comes next.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-38806 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gotham-222JN-0102-hires1-d8b19-300x200.jpg" alt="Gotham-222JN-0102-hires1-d8b19" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gotham-222JN-0102-hires1-d8b19-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gotham-222JN-0102-hires1-d8b19-768x513.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gotham-222JN-0102-hires1-d8b19-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gotham-222JN-0102-hires1-d8b19-620x414.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gotham-222JN-0102-hires1-d8b19.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Gotham &#8211; Transference</strong></span><br />
I don&#8217;t know where to start. Everything about this episode was a tragedy. It provided some conclusions, but only in the context of introducing more problems. So many moments in this episode that were supposed to be dramatic were overshadowed by their sheer stupidity. There was the big giant bomb, the cartoon parody of Gordon, and Fish&#8217;s cape. Or how about the fact that the show is supposedly sending its main character off to find his estranged girlfriend? Then there&#8217;s that scene at the end when a bus and a cop car play chicken but are interrupted by a gangster with a chain gun. Which, of course, leads to the teased monsters wandering off but staying out of focus so that the writers don&#8217;t have to commit to anything. Except of a clone of Bruce Wayne. Because that makes as much sense as Fish demanding a grilled cheese for no reason. Or as much sense as Strange surviving being simultaneously set on fire and hit with a freeze ray. Really, he was the most disappointing part of this episode. Wong&#8217;s portrayal of this character seemed to be done with a knowing wink to the pure insanity that is <em>Gotham</em>. His ability to take charge based on smug arrogance was entertaining and necessary. Reducing him to a spluttering idiot took away one of the only good parts of the show. Without a doubt, season three will be even worse. There will be monsters of the week, a secret society running the city, and the typical sitcom shenanigans when a clone shows up. After two full seasons, I finally know what <em>Gotham</em> is. It&#8217;s what you get when you ask a 6 year old to tell you about Batman. Nothing makes sense, characters do the most random things possible, and plot elements come and go at the speed of easily distractible thought. But everything seems great, simply due to the pure unknowing joy of the story teller. At this point, I think it&#8217;s far past the writers&#8217; nap time. Enough is enough.</p>

I will never not get chills during the &#8220;road so far&#8221; montage. Unfortunately, this time, it was mostly a collection of the dumbest moments from the season. The episode itself was strange. At one point, I expected the season to end with Sam and Dean becoming God and the Darkness. Because why not. But the actual events were even weirder. Randomly bringing in another chapter of the Men of Letters just doesn&#8217;t make sense. Obviously, it&#8217;s a lead-in to next season. But given the final moments, these events seem to echo back to the many other times that Sam and Dean are separated by events out of their control. This isn&#8217;t a big enough hook to get me excited. It&#8217;s just puzzling. The soul bomb was yet another &#8220;last ditch plan that was a possibility all along but no-one ever mentioned it&#8221; which happens a lot in this show. The resolution between Chuck and Amara was somewhat rewarding, but not exciting. I like seeing a conclusion that isn&#8217;t all about punching, but after an entire season of struggle, I wanted more. And lastly, Mary&#8217;s appearance was predictable as soon as Amara spoke The big question, as it always is with a <em>Supernatural</em> finale, is what comes next? I can&#8217;t even begin to predict next season&#8217;s events. I want things to pick up immediately following these final moments. But I also can see the show picking up after a few months. Ultimately, I felt like this season was a chore. I am a die-hard <em>Supernatural</em> fan, but there were too many dull, boring filler episodes and the big important moments were few and far between. The big problem that the Winchesters faced was so far above their skill level that they were forced to the side lines the entire season. While the elements of the story were the biggest to date for the show, the way they were dealt with was some of the weakest. I think a return to tight, personal stories focused on the characters that matter will be the best path to recovery. The show also left one huge questioned unanswered&#8230;what happened to Death?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-38808 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ar423a0142bjpg-685457_765w-300x200.jpg" alt="ar423a0142bjpg-685457_765w" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ar423a0142bjpg-685457_765w-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ar423a0142bjpg-685457_765w-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ar423a0142bjpg-685457_765w-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ar423a0142bjpg-685457_765w.jpg 765w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arrow &#8211; Schism</strong></span><br />
Just like the title of this finale, my opinions about what happened are split. One one hand, the episode provided effective closure to the entire <em>Arrow</em> universe, let alone this season. If there was not a season five, the show could end successfully. The utter destruction of everything Oliver created provided an effective final chapter to his story. Taking steps to do what he always intended as Oliver, not the Arrow, is a huge moment of development and evolution for the character. But on the other hand, the final showdown was a tremendous let down after an entire season of build up. The entire thing boiled down to a street brawl, just like in previous seasons. Rallying the town against the bad guys happened again. Merlyn showing up to kind of help happened again. And beyond the repetition, the ultimate solution to Darhk&#8217;s magic was underwhelming. All of the flashbacks to the island had nothing to do with what happened. Oliver&#8217;s one tiny speech, which inspiring, didn&#8217;t carry the implied impact necessary to unite the entire city behind him. And I know that there was that one quick shot of a guy filming the speech and televising it, but this feels like the lamest and easiest short cut that the writers could figure out to provide a solution. Furthermore, the moment of this support negating Darhk&#8217;s power was far too quick and underplayed. Reducing an entire season of tension to a one-on-one fight was not the worst thing that could&#8217;ve happened. It reinforced the themes of Oliver&#8217;s ultimate responsibility for everything that has and will continue to happen. I did not dislike this episode, but it was not what I expected at all. I enjoyed Darhk as a villain, especially when he snapped and committed to his plan after losing his wife. It showed a human side behind the evil scheme. In all honesty, I wanted to see his plan succeed. I think a post-apocalyptic setting would be a perfect place for Team Arrow to exist. The show could&#8217;ve taken on a survivalist theme and a Mad Max style. Running around shooting arrows makes a lot more sense in this world than the modern one. With the ending as it was, there is truly no context for what will happen next season. I fear that it will be focused on reassembling the team, essentially, rebooting the series. But I am looking forward to the potential shenanigans of Oliver balancing being a mayor and being Green Arrow.</p>

Really? That&#8217;s how season two ends? This is not good. Flashpoint is such a cool story from the comics but I don&#8217;t know how it will carry over to the television universe. I want it to work. But that means logically that both <em>Arrow</em> and <em>Legends</em> will have to reflect these changes. They share a universe, so they have to be impacted by the change in the timeline. Obviously, the TV show and the comics are two different things. But <em>Flash</em> is so good at mirroring its source that I can&#8217;t for a second imagine that season three will not deal with the same consequences as the comics did. However, anything can happen between now and the fall. As a season finale goes, this episode did well. It resolved the main plot, answered the one huge question that had been looming over the entire season, and left viewers with a huge cliff hanger. I enjoyed the episode, but I did not think it was one of the season&#8217;s highlights. A lot of events felt forced. Many of the scenes felt like they lacked the polish and skill that has been otherwise apparent this season. The reveal of the real Jay was rewarding, but it still felt hollow. Maybe it was because he seemed so awkward in his costume and acted like a bit of a jerk. The whole time clone thing was confusing and over-played. As was the race at the end. Having the entire conflict end with a race makes sense in a way, but only because Zoom was taken from terrifying villain to cheesy insane bad guy. Racing around the thing that was supposed to destroy the multiverse makes no sense. Even if Barry won, he&#8217;d still be generating the necessary power. There wasn&#8217;t any way out of this situation other than miraculous Speedforce powers. I expected an outstanding episode that would wrap up the season, like the finale of season one. Instead, this finale was messy. The only really exciting scene was the last one, and that&#8217;s only because I read the comics and know what it means. As a viewer of the show with no knowledge of the comics, this episode is just plan confusing. However, season two was a huge win for <em>Flash</em>. It demonstrated the ability to take on more challenging stories, add characters, and maintain that perfect tone of drama and comedy. I wish the the teases at the other speedsters had paid off. And I wish that Barry hadn&#8217;t been so quickly forced from joy to heartbreak. His character growth was undone and he returned to making very selfish choices. It&#8217;s not a bad thing, because the context of the decision makes sense with what he suffered. But he is clearly choosing to abandon the family and support structure that exists for him. That being said, I am exited for what comes next.</p>

<p><em>Game of Thrones </em>continues to delight in season 6&#8217;s whirlwind of surprises. We got a lot of interesting developments this week including the reveal of a long awaited character with very frosty paws. We also get to see Sam man up a bit to his real jerk of a father. Also, it looks like Danny may finally be doing something with her plot line! She has all the pieces and place and her world and Westeros could collide in spectacular fashion.</p>
<p>And lets not forget Arya, she is leaving the faith and finding her roots again, and we couldn&#8217;t be happier.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With DC Comics even closer to pressing ‘reset’ on its entire line of comics, it’s fast becoming time to decide what to throw your hard earned coin down on. And what to avoid like the plague. Last week we had a look at <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/dc-rebirth-rundown-superman/">the Superman books (and Wonder Woman)</a> that would be launching and the week before that we had a squiz at <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/dc-rebirth-run-down-batman/">the Dark Knights new range</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38686" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/banner.jpg" alt="banner" width="1900" height="900" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/banner.jpg 1900w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/banner-300x142.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/banner-768x364.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/banner-1200x568.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/banner-298x141.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/banner-620x294.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1900px) 100vw, 1900px" /></strong></p>
<p>Of course, there are other superheroes in the DC universe. Some of which even fight alongside Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. So this week we’ll be going over some of the ‘smaller’ heroes that make up DC and some of the series where these team ups take place. Top of the list is the most important of all, <em>Justice League</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Writer: </strong>Bryan Hitch<br />
<strong>Artist: </strong>Tony Daniel<br />
<strong>Rebirth One Shot?: </strong>But of course, with superstar Geoff Johns leaving the series, Bryan Hitch’ll be ushering in a new era for the Justice League.</p>
<div id="attachment_38675" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38675 size-large" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jl-rebirth-790x1200.jpg" alt="Justice League Rebirth: On Sale July 6th" width="620" height="942" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jl-rebirth-790x1200.jpg 790w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jl-rebirth-197x300.jpg 197w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jl-rebirth-768x1167.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jl-rebirth-298x453.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jl-rebirth-620x942.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jl-rebirth.jpg 987w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Justice League Rebirth: On Sale July 6th</p></div>
<p><strong>The Creative Team: </strong>Bryan Hitch is something of a big name in the comic’s world, having made his start at the tender age of 17 with Marvel UK. As an artist however, not a writer. As an artist Hitch’s career seemed to explode, doing work for both DC and Marvel on a variety of series. Of particular note is his work on <em>The Ultimates, The Ultimates 2</em> and <em>Fantastic Four </em>with Mark Millar. Hitch was also brought on later in his career as a designer for the 2005 relaunch of <em>Doctor Who </em>and the first relaunched <em>Star Trek </em>film. On top of that, the art in his creator owned <em>Real Heroes </em>was praised highly. But Bryan Hitch is not the artist for <em>Justice League</em>, he’s the writer. While I have enjoyed his limited series <em>JLA</em> from both an art and story perspective, <em>Real Heroes </em>was described as mildly unoriginal with characters that felt flat. Again, I’ve really enjoyed <em>JLA</em>, but that does raise the point that Hitch just doesn’t have that much experience as a writer, so perhaps some caution is in order.</p>
<p>Whatever the story is like, it’s sure to look good with Tony Daniels on art. After an acclaimed run on <em>Teen Titans </em>with Geoff Johns, Daniels moved onto <em>Batman </em>with Grant Morrison which was again congratulated for it’s art. Daniels then found himself in the position of both writing and drawing the New 52’s <em>Detective Comics</em> which was labelled average in terms of story, but stellar in terms of art.</p>

<p><strong>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </strong>The Justice League are the greatest heroes DC has on offer. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, The Flash and Green Lantern. Expect high stakes, superhero action, and big scale stories. Bryan Hitch has said that his first arc will have “major ramifications” for the rest of the DC universe, whether you think that’s a good thing or not is up to you. Bryan Hitch isn’t regarded as an amazing writer, but he isn’t regarded as a terrible one either. With all his energy on writing rather than doing both, perhaps he’ll be okay. Either way, Tony Daniels is excellent and produces good work so you’re looking for an exciting, all-star series, this may be the one.</p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Teen Titans</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Writer: </strong>Benjamin Percy<br />
<strong>Artist: </strong>Jonboy Meyers<br />
<strong>Rebirth One Shot?: </strong>Surely is, Damian Wayne will be bringing the Titans together later this year.</p>
<div id="attachment_38685" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-38685" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/teen-titans-rebirth.jpg" alt="Teen Titans: Rebirth- On Sale " width="600" height="910" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/teen-titans-rebirth.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/teen-titans-rebirth-198x300.jpg 198w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/teen-titans-rebirth-298x452.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Teen Titans: Rebirth- On Sale September 21st</p></div>
<p><strong>The Creative Team: </strong>Benjamin Percy is quite different from other writers in this article, having written other comics for several years before making the jump to DC. Percy in fact appears to be quite the accomplished writer, having written five books and a variety of short stories for more magazines than I have ever read. In addition to that, he has also won the Plimpton Prize and the Whitman Award for short story writing. Despite this, his work in comics has been received in a mixed fashion at best. His work on <em>Green Arrow </em>was described as ‘preachy’ and ‘melodramatic’, while his two-parter on <em>Detective Comics </em>was either called a mess or one of the best stories yet. So who’s to really say how his run on <em>Teen Titans</em> will turn out? He’s a writer with obvious experience and talent, but can he bring it to the table for <em>Teen Titans</em>?</p>
<p>Jonboy Meyers seems to be an artist with a whole bevy of credits behind him. Starting on indie comics in the 90’s before his big break with Marvel on <em>Spiderman</em>. Meyers has worked on a variety of series for both DC and Marvel, as well as some work for Image. Well received on an art front, Meyers is a highly experienced artist with a distinctive style.</p>

<p><strong>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </strong>I’m not really up on the play with Teen Titans books, so I don’t know how this compares to the past. Benjamin Percy is shaking things up by having Batman’s son, Damian Wayne, hunt down the other members of the Titans to get them to join him. An intriguing concept to say the least, but one that doesn’t appeal to me personally. Percy is known for being a writer with something to say with his stories; what would he be planning on saying with <em>Teen Titans</em>? Something interesting at least if past work is anything to go by, but the actual story substance remains to be seen. The art should be fantastic and Meyer’s initial designs of the Titans look good at least. A book, I feel, for those already interested in the idea of the Teen Titans.</p>

<h2><strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Titans</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Writer:</strong> Dan Abnett<br />
<strong>Artist: </strong>Brett Booth<br />
<strong>Rebirth One Shot?: </strong>Yes indeed, unlike other new series, <em>Titans</em> kicks things off with a one shot.</p>
<div id="attachment_38682" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38682 size-large" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/titans-rebirth-781x1200.jpg" alt="titans rebirth" width="620" height="953" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/titans-rebirth.jpg 781w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/titans-rebirth-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/titans-rebirth-768x1180.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/titans-rebirth-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/titans-rebirth-620x953.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Titans: Rebirth- On Sale June 15th</p></div>
<p><strong><br />
The Creative Team: </strong>Dan Abnett is an author with a lot of clout. Starting his career all the way back in 1988, Abnett appears to have never stopped writing. Creator of several of the longest running <em>2000AD</em> stories and several long running Warhammer series, Abnett has a lot of science fiction experience. This has served him well with Abnett also being a large figure in the ‘cosmic’ arm of the Marvel universe, writing multiple series, mini series and limited series for Marvel over the years. In addition to that he’s also written a variety of sci-fi for DC comics, including a successful reboot of <em>Legion of Supeheroes. </em>Abnett is not just prolific however, he’s also very, very good. Obviously which such a long career, he hasn’t struck gold every time, but most of his work is received well and his Warhammer books for Games Workshop have sold well over a million copies. A talent indeed.</p>
<p>On the art side is another veteran, though not with quite the same amount of experience or volume of work as Abnett. Brett Booth is the co-creator of <em>Backlash </em>with artistic powerhouse Jim Lee which is no mean feat. He’s also had several successful runs on <em>Spiderman, Fantastic Four </em>and <em>X-Men</em>. I was wondering why I couldn’t find Booth’s name attached to more series, and then I discovered that he is apparently a paleoartist, a dinosaur drawer, professionally. So, not exactly a small fry artist with no talent.</p>

<p><strong>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </strong>I have no idea. And I don’t mean that in the same way I talked about <em>Action Comics </em>last week; I mean no real concrete details have been released as of yet. The team will consist of Nightwing, Donna Troy, Arsenal, Garth, and Lilith; an interesting line up. But as for the actual story, no one knows. With a writer like Abnett on board, there’s a high likelihood it’ll be good. That said, I never feel too comfortable with series that keep everything under wraps. Makes me nervous.</p>

<strong>Artist: </strong>Carmine Di Giandoenico<br />
<strong>Rebirth One Shot?: </strong>But of course, with a large role promised in <em>DC Universe Rebirth</em>, Joshua Williamson will be continuing the action in this one shot.</p>
<div id="attachment_38703" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-38703" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flash-rebirth-790x1200.jpg" alt="The Flash: Rebirth- On Sale June 8th" width="620" height="942" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flash-rebirth-790x1200.jpg 790w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flash-rebirth-198x300.jpg 198w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flash-rebirth-768x1166.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flash-rebirth-298x452.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flash-rebirth-620x941.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flash-rebirth.jpg 988w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Flash: Rebirth- On Sale June 8th</p></div>
<p><strong><br />
The Creative Team: </strong>I have just spent a good little while looking Joshua Williamson up on the internet as I had no idea who he was. Now I am ashamed that I didn’t. Getting his start around ten years ago, Williamson seems to have paid his dues writing and contributing to a variety of limited runs and one-shots before having the chance to do his own thing. Now he is the writer of <em>Nailbiter </em>and <em>Birthright</em> for Image, and just recently finished <em>Ghosted </em>(also for Image). All 3 of these series have been met with rave reviews and high sales with reviewers praising Williamson’s characterization, stories and dialogue. I’d never heard of him until today, now I want to go out and read everything he’s done. Well, maybe not <em>General Mills Presents: Unstoppable Heroes</em>. But we’ve all got to start somewhere right?</p>
<p>On the other side of the creative team is another guy I’ve never heard of, Carmine Di Giandoenico. He’s Italian and most his work is in his native language. What he has done in English however, is great. His distinctive style on <em>Spiderman Noir</em> being very well received despite a lack-luster plot. He’s got a distinctive style and it looks like it would work well with <em>The Flash</em>.</p>

<p><strong>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </strong>This run on <em>The Flash </em>will be spinning straight out of <em>DC Universe: Rebirth</em> and Barry finds himself having to deal with random people becoming speedsters. Top stuff. Williamson has said that while this in of itself is difficult, one of the people granted this speed is a serial killer who hates speedsters. The idea isn&#8217;t super original, but considering how Williamson’s other series have been received, I’m very hopeful. He’s also expressed a strong desire to not only make his own mark, but to also bring in old villains, so this Flash series could be a strong pick of DC Rebirth.</p>

The Creative Team: </strong>Beginning his career with the incredibly bizarre, but well received, <em>Our Love Is Real,</em> Sam Humphries is most definitely an odd writer. Going on to pen a a variety of series for Marvel, as well as a few one-shots and limited series, Humphries has nothing if not a distinctive style. Writing <em>Legendary Star Lord</em>, <em>Planet Hulk (Battleworld) </em>and various issues of various Avengers lines, Humphries has been received (overall) pretty well. Known for being distinctly weird and willing to have just about anything happen, Humphries comics are fun. That said, he can be inconsistent with some issues he’s written being fantastic, and others down right bad.</p>
<p>Hailing from Brazil, Robson Rocha is an artist with a small number of consistent credits behind him. A fairly well received run on <em>Birds of Prey</em> and <em>Earth 2: Worlds End</em>, Rocha has been highlighted as having a flair for battle scenes. Outside of this, Rocha has yet to have an extended run on anything, limited only to single issues or runs of two or three.</p>

<p><strong>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </strong>I am a huge Green Lantern fan. Geoff Johns run on the character was fantastic and sadly is yet to be matched or even have anything come close. That said, I’m still looking forward to this series. Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz are to be the lanterns in this series, watching over Earth while Hal Jordan does whatever it is he does in <em>Hal Jordan and The Green Lantern Corps</em>. Both characters have been introduced in the last couple years, but haven’t really been utilized that much. I’m interested to see how they’re handled as Simon is a muslim immigrant and Jessica the first woman lantern from Earth. The first arc will be kicking off with the Red Lanterns setting their sights on Earth for some nefarious purpose. Hardly original, but considering Humphries penchant for the odd, this could well be the kick-start the Green Lantern arm of DC needs. That said, Humphries is inconsistent and Green Lantern is about more than just crazy space cops. So, fingers tentatively crossed for this one.</p>

<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Creative Team: </strong>I’ll do this just once, and leave my bias against Robert Venditti at the door. Venditi got his start in 2002 with <em>The Surrogates</em>, a sci-fi mini-series with Top Shelf. The series was received very well with critics quite complimentary of Venditti’s writing and story. He even went on to write a prequel for the series that was also well received. He’s also the writer of <em>XO-Manowar</em> for Valient comics. This was a sci-fi, superhero romp that, again, was very well received. By all critical accounts, Venditti is a great writer.</p>
<p>Ethan Van Sciver is equally as good. His work on <em>Green Lantern</em>, <em>The Flash </em>and <em>Green Lantern: Rebirth</em> is regarded as some of the best around. Starting at the tender age of 19, Sciver has been in the business for far longer than some. And his distinctive style and incredible attention to detail really show it.</p>

<p><strong>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </strong>Okay, look, Venditti’s run on <em>Green Lantern</em>, objectively, isn’t terrible. I even enjoyed a few issues. But overall, it’s not that great. It’s not even awful, it’s just average. The premise of this series is likewise. With Hal Jordan still a fugitive and the rest of the corps still missing, the Sinestro Corps step in to enforce their terrifying brand of justice on the galaxy. If you find that interesting, great, but the rest of the corps really needs to be here for me to be convinced. Overall, Ethan Van Sciver is an amazing artist and I really like his work, but Robert Venditti is just far, far too uneven for me to really recommend this book.</p>

<p><strong><u><br />
</u>The Creative Team: </strong>we’ve already talked about Dan Abnett, so we’ll move on. If you skipped ahead, rest assured that he’s a fantastic writer with a long career behind him. Now, to our three artists.</p>
<p>Brad Walker has a short, if well regarded career. He’s worked on a very wide variety of series. Single issues here and there or perhaps a small run on an off-shoot series, but nothing too large. His largest run appears to be on DC’s S<em>inestro </em>and <em>New Guardians</em>, both from the last few years. Both series, while tonally uneven in terms of story, were regarded as being very well drawn. And indeed Walker appears to be well regarded wherever he sets his pencils.</p>
<p>Also on art is Jesus Merino. Starting on a variety of non-English comics before getting work as an inker for a small range of series, Merino has a fair bit of experience. He’s also gone on to do the art for the New 52 version of <em>Superman</em> with George Perez, as well as a few single issues here and there. Most of his experience I can’t comment on as it’s in Spanish and thus, almost impossible to find.</p>
<p>Crossing into yet another country I’ve never been to, Phil Briones is a French artist with, frankly, very few credits behind him. It’s longest run was a period on <em>New Suicide Squad</em> which was received with a resounding ‘eh’.</p>
<p><strong><u>Brad Walker</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </strong>Despite two thirds of the art team being strictly in the ‘okay’ category, I would say yes, it is worth it. <em>Aquaman </em>seems to be a series that, to be successful, it needs a certain creativity behind it. He’s a hero that is decidedly unsuited to regular stories and I think that Dan Abnett has the track record required. The only thing that gives me pause is the premise of the first arc. It’s been described as Aquaman’s efforts to unite the sea and land, but that’s a premise that’s been covered fairly extensively in the past. What new ground is going to be tread? Who can say? Despite this, I would actually recommend this series simply on the strength of its writer.</p>

<h2><strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cyborg (Twice Monthly)</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Writer: </strong>John Semper<br />
<strong>Artist: </strong>Wil Conrad<br />
<strong>Rebirth One Shot?: </strong>Yes indeed, the New 52 series gets a fresh start on August 3<sup>rd</sup> (No cover just yet)</p>
<p><strong>The Creative Team: </strong>My research into John Semper started quietly. I had no idea who he was. As I read, I found myself saying “oh he did that too?” more and more often. Semper is not actually a comic book writer, though he is tangentially involved, being the main writer for <em>Spider-Man</em> the cartoon. Semper has also been a writer/producer/show-runner for a variety of other cartoons, including <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> and <em>Scooby Doo</em>. For me what stood out was he was the creator of <em>Static Shock</em>, one of my favorite shows as a kid. Semper is widely regarded as an excellent writer for TV, and has won a handful of awards for doing so. Color me quite excited for this one.</p>
<p>I’m not unexcited, but I’m hardly over the moon with the choice of artist for <em>Cyborg</em>. Wil Conrad is not terrible by any stretch, he just doesn’t have the same level of experience as John Semper. The bulk of his work comes from Dark Horses <em>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</em> series as well as a few issues of DC’s <em>Nightwing </em>and <em>Stormwatch. </em>Potentially <em>Cyborg</em> will be his breakout series?</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-38729" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/conrad-1-198x300.jpg" alt="conrad 1" width="350" height="530" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/conrad-1-198x300.jpg 198w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/conrad-1-298x452.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/conrad-1.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" />         <img class="alignnone wp-image-38730" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/conrad-2-200x300.jpg" alt="conrad 2" width="350" height="524" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/conrad-2-200x300.jpg 200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/conrad-2-298x446.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/conrad-2-620x929.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/conrad-2.jpg 641w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </strong>Much like <em>Aquaman</em>, the premise of the first arc is one that has been trod many times before. Namely, Cyborg’s relationship between his mechanical and human parts. Is he a machine? Is he a man? Semper promises a “hippie journey” as he discovers the answer to this question whilst also dealing with “being a black man in Detroit”. Considering the immense television pedigree of its writer, I would say that yes, <em>Cyborg </em>is a great series to jump on if you’re after a superhero series with a bit of a different flair.</p>
<p><strong><u>What I’ll Be Taking Away</u></strong></p>
<p>This is difficult. On the one hand, I’m a stalwart Green Lantern fan. I will be picking up <em>Green Lanterns</em> and <em>Hal Jordan and The Green Lantern Corps</em>. But I just don’t think I’ll be that satisfied. So with that, I&#8217;ll grabbing <em>Justice League</em> to continue on my run, <em>Aquaman </em>because I&#8217;m curious and <em>The Flash</em> because I convinced myself it would be good. Will I be satisfied with all of these? Possibly, possibly not. But, I am definitely looking forward to reading all of them, and that&#8217;s what counts.</p>

<p>This week, The Quizzich Cup has an exciting (double) conclusion &#8211; WHO WILL CLAIM VICTORY? WHO WILL GO HOME WITH THE COVETED QUIZZICH CUP? We also learn just who Harry encounters trying to steal the sorcerer&#8217;s stone, we have a run in with the Dark Lord, and we maybe eat some earwax. Oh, and we ask <em>What&#8217;s the Deal With</em> Dumbledore&#8217;s point system? Really.</p>

A brother of the Night&#8217;s Watch brings her a note with the Arryn sigil on it; it&#8217;s a note from Petyr asking her to meet him in Mole&#8217;s Town. Sansa meets him there but not alone; she has Brienne with her. Petyr seems to think that Sansa would be overjoyed and thankful to know that he has come to her aid but Sansa is pissed, because she knows Petyr knew at least a little about Ramsay&#8217;s proclivity for cruelty and he still approved their marriage. She makes Petyr think about what Ramsay did to her and tells him that she can still feel what he did to her because she is still in physical pain as a result of it. She doesn&#8217;t need him anymore and she doesn&#8217;t need his help. She could have Brienne kill him then and there if she wanted. Petyr is willing to do whatever he can in his power for her, even give up his life (yeah, okay). Before he leaves, he informs her that Brynden Blackfish, Catelyn&#8217;s uncle, has taken Riverrun back and that she should seek him out because she will need an army eventually. When she retorts that she has an army, Petyr points out that the army is Jon&#8217;s army &#8211; her <em>half</em>-brother.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Arya and the Waif are still practicing fighting. The Waif doesn&#8217;t think she&#8217;s ready yet but Arya keeps trying to fight. The Waif is like &#8220;u lookin&#8217; for a propa fight, m8?&#8221;, throws her stick down, just straight fights Arya with her bare hands, and still wins! She tells Arya that Arya will never be one of them and calls her Lady Stark. Jaqen says the Waif might be right and leads Arya to the room of faces. He tells her the story of the first Faceless Men, who were slaves in Valyria. The Many Faced God taught the first Faceless Man was taught how to shed his face and give the gift, and that man taught others. The Faceless Men fled Valyria and founded Braavos and built the House of Black and White. The first Faceless Men&#8217;s faces hang in the room of faces and Arya can be one of them if she desires. Arya is like &#8220;bro, I know what you&#8217;re doing &#8211; a girl has no desires.&#8221; So Jaqen gives her a vial of poison, which means she has a new target &#8211; an actress by the name of Lady Crane. This is Arya&#8217;s 2nd chance and there will not be a 3rd &#8211; one way or another, a face will be added to the hall.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-38645 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/maxresdefault-2-300x169.jpg" alt="maxresdefault" width="850" height="479" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/maxresdefault-2-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/maxresdefault-2-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/maxresdefault-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/maxresdefault-2-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/maxresdefault-2-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/maxresdefault-2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Arya goes to watch the play in which Lady Crane appears as Cersei &#8211; the play seems to amuse Arya until the character of Ned comes up, portrayed as being dimwitted and power hungry (it also portrays Tyrion as having masterminded the whole thing). Arya is not into the play after that. She goes backstage after the play and kind of just loiters, trying to find out info about Lady Crane. (How about that warty uncircumcised penis? Ladies, never complain about there not being dicks in the show, because apparently this is what we get by complaining.) She finds out that Lady Crane is the better actress and that she is pregnant. Arya goes back to Jaqen and tells him of her plan to poison Lady Crane&#8217;s rum, which only she drinks. She is curious to know whether the younger actress is the one who paid to have Lady Crane&#8217;s life taken, and questions killing a person who seems like a decent human being. Jaqen reminds her that as a servant of the Many Faced God, she is not in the position to ask questions.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Bran and the Three Eyed Raven are visioning again, beyond the Wall, watching the Children of the Forest stab a dude tied to a tree. But they don&#8217;t really stab him &#8211; they insert a Dragonglass dagger inside the dude&#8217;s chest, which turns the dude&#8217;s eyes blue. Bran is startled awake and confronts the Children about creating the White Walkers. Leaf, one of the Children, tells him that they were at war with the First Men, being slaughtered and desperate &#8211; they created the White Walkers to defend themselves from the Men.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">They are holding the King&#8217;s Moot at Pyke and Yara/Asha steps forward to claim the salt throne. She makes a speech about leading the Iron Islands into building the biggest fleet of ships and making a mark on the world. People aren&#8217;t into having a Queen, so Theon is prodded forward to claim the throne, but instead he speaks out in support of his sister. People seem to be on board but Euron Greyjoy shows up and claims the salt throne. When Yara accuses him of murdering Balon, he goes &#8220;yeah I did it. He was a terrible king and was leading us nowhere. I should&#8217;ve killed him earlier.&#8221; He set his plans in front of the Ironborn to bring glory back to the Iron Islands: he&#8217;s going to build a massive fleet, sail to Meereen, where he will woo Dany into marrying him, bring her and her dragons to Westeros, and conquer the Seven Kingdoms. The Ironborn are totally into this plan and he is declared king. While he is being baptized in the sea by Aeron Greyjoy, Theon, Yara, and their men steal away into the best ships and flee the Iron Islands. After being baptized, Euron is crowned king with a driftwood crown, and he vows to build a fleet of ships to go after and kill Theon and Yara. Good family reunion.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Jorah finally tells Dany that he loves her annnnnnd he has greyscale. He tries to take his leave but Dany is not having that &#8211; she commands him to travel throughout the lands and find a fucking cure for his dang disease. Easy peasy. Together with the Dothraki and Daario, Dany sets off back to Meereen.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In Meereen, they&#8217;re seeing the results of their peace accord with the Masters but Tyrion thinks they should do more. The Sons of the Harpy had a compelling story to captivate the population and persuade them into helping with their &#8220;cause&#8221;. Well, they need a better story for Dany &#8211; sure she freed the slaves but the people now need to know that she is providing them with safety and security. To do this, they need good storytellers. Enter Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis. Tyrion wants her to help spread the word about Dany and Kinvara is totally on board because she believes that Dany is the Prince that was Promised. Tyrion is thankful but Varys has had terrible experience with people who practice magic, so he&#8217;s skeptical about the Red Priestess. He questions her about the other Red Priestess (Melisandre) who declared Stannis as the Prince that was Promised. Kinvara stays calm and says that everything is the Lord&#8217;s Will, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that men and women can&#8217;t make mistakes, as did Melisandre with Stannis. She then reveals to Varys that she knows what was done to him and by whom, and can also tell him the words uttered by the voice in the flames and tell him who spoke them. Varys is unnerved and stops questioning her. She takes her leave, promising that they can trust her because they serve the same Queen.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Bran is bored and tries to awaken the Three Eyed Raven, but he keeps snoozing. So, like a petulant teen, he scoots over and wargs into the tree by himself, something he&#8217;s <em>not </em>supposed to do. WHY DON&#8217;T YOU LEAVE THINGS ALONE BRAN? He sees an army of the wights and starts walking through them. At the end of the army, he sees four White Walkers on horses, including the Night&#8217;s King, who can FUCKING SEE BRAN. Bran gets freaked out turns around to see that the army is now turned around to face him and can also see him. Bran, in his flustered and scared state, turns around to find the Night&#8217;s King right behind him and he grabs at his arm. Bran leaves the vision and is back in the cave. He tells the Three Eyed Raven what happened and he asks Bran if the Night&#8217;s King touched him. Yup, Bran has marks on his arm from where the Night&#8217;s King grabbed him. The Three Eyed Raven is like &#8220;you gotsa get out of here because they are coming for you.&#8221; Turns out, because Bran has the mark of the Night&#8217;s King, they can find him and the protections of the cave will not work to keep them out. GODDAMN IT BRAN. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO LOOK? WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO LOOK? The Three Eyed Raven for Bran to become him even though he&#8217;s not ready, and takes him into another vision.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">At the Wall, Jon and Co. are strategizing about how to bring their numbers up. The Umbers and the Karstarks have declared for the Boltons, but the Manderlys are still up for grabs. Sansa tries to school Davos on the people of the North but her speech about the Notherners being loyal seems a little naive &#8211; she expects people to risk their life and limb for her family. Davos doesn&#8217;t know the North but knows men &#8211; when it comes down to it, each man wants to protect their own family. Jon recommends trying to rally the small houses; if they get the smaller houses on their side, the number would equal that of the bigger houses. Sansa insists that the North will rise again to defend the Starks, and even though Jon is not a Stark, he is still as much a son of Ned as Ramsay was of Roose. They also have her &#8211; she actually has the Stark name. She lies and tells them that Ramsay got a raven before she left, saying the Tullys had raised and army and taken back Riverrun. She has gotten pretty good at lying now. The rest are heartened by this news and make preparations to leave the Wall. Sansa is sending Brienne to Riverrun to speak with Brynden and Brienne does not want to leave Sansa. Sansa says she trusts Jon and Brienne asks why she lied to him if she trusts him. They&#8217;re getting ready to leave and Sansa has on a new dress and coat with the Stark sigil on them. She has also made one for Jon, modeled after the cloak Ned used to wear. Edd is now the Lord Commander of the Wall, which he realizes after Jon leaves. Also, how into Brienne is Tormund? I want this relationship to happen plz. I need it in my life, especially after the sadness that is coming.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Meera is preparing to leave with Hodor and Bran, talking to Hodor about all the food they&#8217;re going to eat when she realizes that they can see their breaths. She runs to the mouth of the cave, where the Children are standing, and sees the army of the Wights. Leaf tells her to get Bran and run, while the Children throw their firebomb things at the wights. They make a semi circle of fire at the entrance of the cave but that does not deter the White Walkers. They walk on in while the wights climb up to the tree and try to burrow down to the cave. Meera tries to wake Bran up but to no avail. Bran and the Three Eyed Raven are watching young Ned leaving Winterfell for the Vale. The wights start attacking inside the cave; Meera and the Children try to fight them off while Hodor is too scared to fight. Meera yells for Bran to warg into Hodor, which he hears inside the vision and the Three Eyed Raven tells him to do as Meera asks. In doing so, he wargs into Hodor in the past (the vision) and in the present (in the cave). Hodor picks up Bran and starts making his way to the exit. Summer stays back to hold off the Wights but is killed in the process. RIP Summer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-38638 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/enhanced-17245-1464007373-2-300x158.jpg" alt="enhanced-17245-1464007373-2" width="769" height="405" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/enhanced-17245-1464007373-2-300x158.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/enhanced-17245-1464007373-2-298x157.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/enhanced-17245-1464007373-2-620x327.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/enhanced-17245-1464007373-2.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Night&#8217;s King approaches the Three Eyed Raven who is still warged into the vision with Bran. In the vision, he tells Bran that he has to leave. The Night&#8217;s King kills the Three Eyed Raven and he shatters and blows away in the vision. Leaf sacrifices herself to give them some more time also, blowing herself up along with some wights. When they get to the door, Hodor pushes the door open and they make it outside with just enough time for them to push the door shut. However, the door can&#8217;t be shut all the way and Hodor has to hold the door closed. Meera pushes Bran away while calling back to Hodor to &#8220;hold the door&#8221;. In the vision, Barn hears Meera say &#8220;hold the door&#8221; and realizes that the Hodor in his vision can see him. Young Hodor starts seizing and starts saying &#8220;hold the door&#8221; which eventually becomes &#8220;Hodor&#8221;. Bran realizes his warging into Hodor in the past as well as the present is what created Hodor. In the present, Hodor holds the door, giving enough time for Meera and Bran to get away. RIP Hodor, you happy and gentle man.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This is the last week before the spring season ends. Things are going to get crazy. And <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Legends</span> ends early, with its finale l</em><em>anding this week.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blindspot &#8211; If Love a Rebel, Death Will Render<img class="size-medium wp-image-38602 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blindspot-1x21-9-300x200.jpg" alt="Blindspot - Season 1" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blindspot-1x21-9-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blindspot-1x21-9-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blindspot-1x21-9-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blindspot-1x21-9-620x414.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blindspot-1x21-9.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
For being the penultimate episode in a show about a complex mystery, there wasn&#8217;t much of a build up to the finale. Sure, that last scene with Mayfair was a surprise, but it also feels incredibly cheap. But not as cheap as the final scene with Weller and his father. After spending so much time to repair this relationship, to yank it all away in a &#8220;surprise twist&#8221; is a huge betrayal. Of course, everything in <em>Blindpsot</em> is about betrayal. The majority of this episode was a tattoo of the week revelation of more government conspiracy that had no impact on the main plot. The only important scenes that went towards resolving the actual story were at the beginning and end of the episode. The start of the episode contained the required &#8220;characters that have been lying to each other tell their secrets&#8221; moment and the reveal of what Daylight was. Probably. I don&#8217;t trust anything that&#8217;s happening at this point. However, the explanation felt quick and hurried. For being something that was teased for the entire first half of the season, the facts seem hastily thrown together and far too simple. The implication through this episode is that Jane is not Taylor. She&#8217;s part of a team that set out to reveal conspiracy punish everyone involved in an incredibly complicated plan. That&#8217;s been fairly obvious since the start. I guess that&#8217;s why these &#8220;surprise twists&#8221; are coming. The really mystery of <em>Blindpsot</em> is about who is betraying who. The short answer is &#8220;everyone&#8221;, which isn&#8217;t that exciting. I&#8217;m not saying that I haven&#8217;t enjoyed <em>Blindspot</em> or that I&#8217;m not looking forward to the finale and whatever other twists the show will throw at viewers. <em>Blindpsot</em> has easily been one of the best new shows this season. However, the revelations that are happening now cast previous episodes in a new light and that light is not completely favorable.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-38603 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jada-pinkett-smith-a-legion-of-horribles-gotham-02-600x350-300x175.jpg" alt="jada-pinkett-smith-a-legion-of-horribles-gotham-02-600x350" width="300" height="175" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jada-pinkett-smith-a-legion-of-horribles-gotham-02-600x350-300x175.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jada-pinkett-smith-a-legion-of-horribles-gotham-02-600x350.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jada-pinkett-smith-a-legion-of-horribles-gotham-02-600x350-298x174.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Gotham &#8211; A Legion of Horribles</strong></span><br />
It is staggering how far <em>Gotham</em> goes to top its own insanity. This episode tossed the Court of Owls, Clayface, and another possible Croc or maybe King Shark into the mix. It also brought back Mooney and gave her super powers that are somehow related to a fish but make no actual sense. And I can&#8217;t let her reappearance go without mentioning how painful it was. Seeing her wearing yet another stupid outfit, posing and gesturing like someone who has never moved before, and delivering lines in the most awkward way possible is the stuff of nightmares. How can anyone claim that <em>Gotham</em> is a good show when it consistently makes the worst possible choices? Beyond all of this, Strange&#8217;s roll is getting ever more confusing. He went from a manipulating psychiatrist to a man making genetic monstrosities, to a man being tasked with chasing immortality. And Fox, a character typically defined as intelligent, is now one of the dumbest people in the room. He randomly decides that radioactive material is involved, and that&#8217;s magically confirmed even thought it&#8217;s never been brought up before. His genius plan to sneak Gordon into Arkham involves stuffing him in the trunk and then making chalk marks on the wall. One tiny little chalk arrow in the massive building that is Arkham. How long did Gordon wander the halls looking for it? Oh, and <em>Gotham</em> thinks its viewers are absolute idiots. Gordon obviously used his old employee badge from when he got banished to Arkham for all of two episodes, right? But he never had one of the new uniforms that only just showed up now. Were viewers not supposed to notice this? Or was it just hoped that it would get ignored in the flood of plot holes, bad acting, and ludicrous story elements that are crammed into every episode? This was&#8217;t even a good episode by <em>Gotham</em> standards. It contained far too many new details and developments for the second to last episode of the season. The show should be moving towards resolution of the season&#8217;s story arcs. Instead, it is just adding more in what is clearly a desperate attempt to justify its own existence.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Supernatural &#8211; We Happy Few<img class="size-medium wp-image-38604 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/We_happy_few-300x200.jpg" alt="We_happy_few" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/We_happy_few-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/We_happy_few-768x511.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/We_happy_few-298x198.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/We_happy_few-620x412.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/We_happy_few.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span></span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></span>This episode threw out some big facts very casually. Such as Chuck explaining that the Mark was originally given to Lucifer. Or having Amara blow the wards in the bunker. The majority of the episode was about hashing out personal problems and convincing various powers to join in on the final attack. This had some entertaining moments, but was ultimately very boring. In the old days, <em>Supernatural</em> was about Sam and Dean figuring out a problem through hard work. They were on the front line, getting their hands dirty. Their challenges were resolved by their own effort and determination. Now, they&#8217;re middle men. They facilitate other people doing the work. And that work is usually &#8220;You have magic powers that we don&#8217;t. Please use them now while we stand on the side watching.&#8221; This is not very entertaining. On one hand, I like that the show has evolved over time to put these characters into a larger world with larger problems. But on the other hand, the Winchesters have very little to do with what&#8217;s happening now. Yes, they are directly connected to the story, but their impact on its events is basically zero. The ending of this episode is very questionable. Clearly, the showdown was not going to be resolved, because there&#8217;s still a season finale and no plan in <em>Supernatural</em> ever works properly. The scene with Rowena outside looking at something was very confusing. She was clearly looking at whatever Amara did. But it received no acknowledgement or screen time. There should&#8217;ve been something on the horizon or a looming threat. I would&#8217;ve been fine with a shadow falling over the scene and Rowena looking scared. As it stands, Amara laid the smack down and vanished and the show ended with everyone else looking worried. That&#8217;s incredibly anticlimactic and a very badly written conclusion to the episode. I expect more from this team. I&#8217;m also bothered by Rowena&#8217;s time travel plan. That was just tossed in there without any explanation or reason. Will it now be forgotten? Or will that be the problem for next season? Rowena goes back in time and re-writes history so now the world is controlled by dark forces and the Winchesters have to fix everything. The show has had worse plot lines. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised by anything that happens at this point.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-38605 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/arrow-422-600x400-300x200.jpg" alt="arrow-422-600x400" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/arrow-422-600x400-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/arrow-422-600x400.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/arrow-422-600x400-298x199.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arrow &#8211; Lost in the Flood</strong></span><br />
This was a good lead-in to the season finale. One major threat was ended, and the final showdown is set to be between Team Arrow and the Big Bad Darhk. I also really enjoy the fact that, while it was very late in the game, the show took strides to demonstrate that not everyone saw Darhk as a super villain. It was established early, and reinforced here, that he cared for his family. And if that one family believed in his plans, it&#8217;s logical to assume that most of the other inhabitants did as well. This reflects back to a theme that was defined when Merlyn was the main villain. These villains are the heroes of their own story. They are doing what they think is right. And really, is Oliver doing anything different? As a vigilante, he routinely breaks the law to establish his goals. He justifies his actions by claiming that he is serving the greater good or acting to oppose foes that others cannot face. The exact same argument can be made for Darhk&#8217;s actions. While it might get lost in the action and drama, <em>Arrow</em> is not afraid to deal with the tougher, more serious aspects of the super hero genre. I enjoyed this episode. It delivered great action scenes on all sides of the story and balanced them nicely. It served to set up the finale and make me genuinely excited for what will happen next. I&#8217;m also desperately curious for what will happen as the show moves into season five. There hasn&#8217;t been anything that hints to the next story arc. I appreciate the story being focused, but I also want something isn&#8217;t just thrown in at the last minute. On the other hand, I would also be happy with a full resolution of this arc and a &#8220;let&#8217;s see what happens next&#8221; ending that leaves the show open to incorporate other developments, such as what happens on the other related shows. <em>Arrow</em> could easily handle starting the next season with a jump forward in time and use its flashback formula to reveal previous happenings. They have to run out of events on the island at some point, right? This could be an easy replacement that would make sense as the show moves forward.</p>

I like that post-Speedforce Barry is the first glimpse of the always-positive, heart of the team Flash that exists in most comic books. I want more of this in the future. Black Siren was outstanding. I wish her appearance hand&#8217;t been revealed so early. This would&#8217;ve been an excellent surprise. I also really enjoyed Zoom pointing out the problem that all heroes give themselves. It was a welcome dose of logic. And the Wells/Cisco dynamic was really funny. It&#8217;s been developing this entire season and it&#8217;s always clever and entertaining. I wish that the army of meta-humans had been an actual threat. As I predicted, they got scienced away without being anything exciting. It was cool for that one short scene to see versions of characters from Legends. I really liked the twist on Cisco&#8217;s visions. I was fooled into thinking that the birds were related to the Canary, even though in hindsight, his visions have never been metaphorical. Even with all of these good elements, the show had one big problem. The ending twist was incredibly cheap and manipulative. Zoom has never once stated a motive about wanting to be similar to Barry. That only happened in this episode. To hang such a big event on such weak justification is bad writing. Clearly, this was done to amp up the drama heading into the finale. It was surprising and heart-breaking, especially given the dynamic that Henry brought to the show. But it wasn&#8217;t earned. There is a way to include a surprise twist and have it not be a blatant manipulation of events and emotions. However, this type of cheap move is a common comic book trope. So in that context, it&#8217;s not really that bad. I am sure that it will make the finale next week intense and exciting.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-38607 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/legends-of-tomorrow-legendary-image-7-300x197.jpg" alt="legends-of-tomorrow-legendary-image-7" width="300" height="197" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/legends-of-tomorrow-legendary-image-7-300x197.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/legends-of-tomorrow-legendary-image-7-768x504.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/legends-of-tomorrow-legendary-image-7-298x196.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/legends-of-tomorrow-legendary-image-7-620x407.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/legends-of-tomorrow-legendary-image-7.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Legends of Tomorrow &#8211; Legendary</strong></span><br />
The finale of season one starts with Rip again being a horrible person and every character except the one that actually commented on it getting a scene in 2016 (although the scenes with the Lances don&#8217;t make any sense when compared to the current timeline of <em>Arrow</em>). And there&#8217;s a wonderful &#8220;because comic books&#8221; moment that gets the team back on the trail of Savage. There&#8217;s also a somewhat clever way to tie the Hawks to the Thanagarians that were teased in the last episode. This does add a sense of cohesion that will hopefully carry over to season two. It&#8217;s also a nice nod to the confusing reality of the Hawks in the actual comic books. There are also some other great moments in this episode, such as Firestorm getting a more interesting aspect of his powers and fights with random Nazis. But there were also some unfortunately confusing moments, like Savage randomly getting his goons when facing said Nazis and his horribly complicated plan that stretch even the boundaries of comic book shenanigans. The conclusion of Savage&#8217;s arc was surprising. I did not expect him to get killed off so quickly, especially with him being such an iconic villain and the show taking steps to embrace a larger portion of the DC world. After everything that happened, I felt like Rip&#8217;s death would&#8217;ve been acceptable and very justified, given the evidence of his terrible decisions and actions. The ending with Snart and Rory was the most impactful of everything that happened. The Hawks flying off was confusing. After everything revolving around them, there&#8217;s no  good reason for them to just kick the team to the curb. The ending surprise of revealing not only the Justice Society but Hourman was very cool. However, since the implication is that they exist in the future (and was possibly founded by the team itself), I&#8217;m curious to see how this works out. They were the precursors to the League, after all. For the first season of a show that is a second spin off, <em>Legends</em> had a lot stacked against it. But it was generally successful. It proved again that television is an acceptable medium for the spandex super hero genre. It took on the challenge of delivering the most cliche of the comic book tropes and didn&#8217;t fail. It worked with a large cast and did them all justice. It balanced action, comedy, and drama. Given the context of the show, there are literally endless options for what it could do with season two. I am looking forward to what comes next, and I hope that it will stay intermixed with the shows that are its foundation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here we go folks, the latest comics for the week of May 17th! Each week GeeklyInc takes a look at the new releases and weighs them up. First up this week is the end of the New 52&#8217;s <em>Green Lantern </em>before DC Rebirth at the end of the month.</p>
<h2><img class="wp-image-38536 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Green-lantern.jpg" alt="Green lantern" width="630" height="969" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Green-lantern.jpg 900w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Green-lantern-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Green-lantern-768x1181.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Green-lantern-780x1200.jpg 780w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Green-lantern-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Green-lantern-620x953.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></h2>
<h2><em>Green Lantern #52</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Robert Venditti<br />
Pencils: Billy Tan</em></p>
<p><strong>First Impressions: </strong>This is it. The big one. Robert Venditti’s chance to close a several yearlong run in a big way and usher in a new Green Lantern era. Honestly, my expectations are pretty low. The previous issue was decent, but that was it. I wouldn’t condemn it, but I’d hardly be willing to recommend it. I just don’t think that Venditti has the time or the space to close this current story arc the way it needs to be. There are just too many loose threads. Hal Jordan/Parralax has escaped from another universe and is looking to take our hero out, that very same hero is sporadically turning into pure energy and the Gray Agents have kidnapped Virgo, Trapper and Darlene the spaceship (the only worthy additions that Venditi has contributed to the Green Lantern mythos). While Howard Porter has contributed a super cool cover this month, and I’m open to the idea of being wrong, I feel like I’m going to be disappointed yet again.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: </strong>If I could type out me shrugging my shoulders, I would. A serviceable, but hardly exciting end to the run before Rebirth. Venditti thankfully doesn’t try and wrap everything up in a single issue (not that I seriously thought he would). Rather, he goes for a classic space-cop/bounty hunter throw-down. Much like the fight with Parrallax, Venditti has crafted the action well with the fight progressing pretty smoothly and the whole thing stays interesting throughout. Helping this along is Billy Tan’s art which is, like the previous issue, lovely and crisp. He’s also done a great job of making each Grey Agent stand out; it gives a real dynamic quality to the team and makes me mildly excited for them to (no doubt) appear again.</p>
<p>My only real complaint is that Virgo and Trapper, two of the coolest characters in <em>Green Lantern</em> in a while, are dismissed with little ceremony at the end. After following Hal and gracing our pages for so long, it seemed like an unceremonious way to remove two long standing characters from the series. I will of course be picking up <em>Hal Jordan and The Green Lantern Corps</em>, but really only because I am a glutton for punishment.</p>
<h2><img class="size-full wp-image-38537 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/survivors-8.jpg" alt="survivors 8" width="630" height="969" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/survivors-8.jpg 630w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/survivors-8-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/survivors-8-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/survivors-8-620x954.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></h2>
<h2><em>Survivors Club #8</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Dale Halvorsen and Lauren Beukes<br />
Artist: Ryan Kelly</em></p>
<p><strong>First Impressions: </strong><em>Survivors Club</em> on the other hand has impressed me almost from the start. After a rocky first issue, Halvorsen and Beukes blood-soaked horror about a group of horror movie survivors has morphed into something far more twisted than its premise. With Kiri’s ghost aunt battling the scorpion woman birthed from Teo’s neck, while the evil spirit of Mr Empty terrorises Muskagee house, it’s looking like yet another issue of disturbing excitement. My only question is when it will all end. Obviously a big part of <em>Survivors Club </em>is the constant horror the characters are subjected to, and it’s so far been fantastic. But there is a point where it would be nice to take a breather. I’m just worried that the series will escalate without pause and it’ll all get a little exhausting. But really what’re the chances of that?</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: </strong>I’m not sure how to feel. On the one hand, Halvorsen and Beukes have managed to bring Harv and Mr Empty’s saga to a bloody and satisfying close. On the other hand Teo’s battle with ‘Nena’ the scorpion woman was cool, but incredibly rushed for a series that loves the slow payoff. True to form there is horror a plenty with Mr Empty chasing our heroes through an increasingly bizarre Muskagee house while Simon’s dismembered parents occasionally show up. When Alice and her doll-like double Alice begin searching for Harv, things take a turn for the worse with both the house and the panels getting a little M.C Escher.</p>
<p>The art from Ryan Kelly and the colors from Eva De Cruz are simply fantastic this month. There’s no real stand out piece, as the issue looks great from start to finish. Each section of the story looks and feels distinctive. I particularly enjoyed the ‘death’ of Mr Empty with not only the fantastic amounts of blood working well on all three characters caught in the spray, but the incredible cathartic nature of the scene does wonders for Harv’s character. I look forward to whatever it is he does next.</p>
<p>Teo’s storyline was less satisfying. While it was great to have Nena be a manifestation of Teo’s own childhood issues and something he needs to physically confront, it kind of comes out nowhere and feels very rushed. It would have been better if the fight had either gone on longer, or if Nena had gotten away. As it is, a great and creepy villain is done and dusted far too soon. Overall, another great entry into a great series despite a narrative misstep.</p>

<h2><em>Moon Knight #2</em></h2>
<p><em>Writer: Jeff Lemire<br />
Artist: Greg Smallwood</em></p>
<p><strong>First Impressions: </strong>I am thus far very impressed with my first Marvel series ever. <em>Moon Knight </em>is the story of&#8230; well I’m not actually 100% sure what it’s about at this point, but it’s pretty cool. Jeff Lemire keeps the story on its toes with some serious questions being raised around whether Marc Spector is actually the servant of the god Khonshu, or if he’s just completely insane. The whole story has this very ethereal feel to it and I genuinely don’t know what to expect this month as we delve deeper into Marc’s psychosis.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: </strong>I doubt if I have ever read a more solid issue 2 before. I love the way Jeff Lemire has created essentially two different characters in one body. Marc Spector is, as Khonshu says, weak. His sequences are fragmented, filled with notebook scrawling’s and genuine doubt about the nature of reality. I loved the way Marc’s vision of Khonshu was a brief insight into the lore of the world without giving too much away. <em>Moon Knight </em>is shaping to be a series where the joy is in the unknown.</p>
<p>What I particularly liked was the way Marc was literally the servant of Khonshu. He’s not his emissary or partner, he is fully subservient. It makes his mental and ultimately physical prison break and transformation into ‘Mr Knight’ all that more satisfying. Greg Smallwood’s art is once again perfectly suited to the series, with a splash page of Marc’s insane ramblings on a notebook serving to root us firmly into his broken mind. Equally the way that each portion of the story not only looks different but appears to have been done in a slightly different style really helps the story barrel along. With everything picking up in the last few pages and a host of new characters arriving, I am almost salivating in anticipation for the next issue. Subscribe immediately.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Season finales are right around the corner. Anticipation is high and cliff hangers are drawing ever closer.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blindspot &#8211; Of Whose Uneasy Route<img class="size-medium wp-image-38544 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5b0145fc117817776709d6c92447-300x200.jpg" alt="5b0145fc117817776709d6c92447" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5b0145fc117817776709d6c92447-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5b0145fc117817776709d6c92447-768x513.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5b0145fc117817776709d6c92447-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5b0145fc117817776709d6c92447-620x414.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5b0145fc117817776709d6c92447.jpg 809w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span></p>
<p>Hey, it&#8217;s the return of the bright white room. And an episode that&#8217;s made of a bunch of little bottle episodes. Parts of this episode were solid, like Patterson (as always) and the Jane/Weller dynamic. Other parts were lame, like the Zapata/Mayfair showdown (way too dramatic and heavy-handed) and the elevator scene. A lot of this episode was played for laughs, which is an odd choice for being so late in the season. Most of it worked, and had a bit of a <em>Die Hard</em> vibe, but some were just annoying, like the attorney that existed only as the butt of a joke. This is another episode that attempts to develop the characters  and their relationships, but again, it&#8217;s strange to see this happen so late in the season. I didn&#8217;t dislike this episode, but it had an odd pacing that just didn&#8217;t sit right with me. The gear-up scene in the evidence room ruined the sense of urgency that this episode tried to establish. Furthermore, the hackers and attack on the building had absolutely no connection to the story. It ruins the flow of the season to have a totally random crime happen with no link to anything or anyone. Ultimately, the only thing that mattered in the entire episode was the reveal that Jane&#8217;s actions served to set up Mayfair. But with no explanation of why, the episode closes with a deep sense of betrayal and shock. I always expected <em>Blindspot</em> to drop a twist like this, but I didn&#8217;t expect it at the end of such a strange episode. This is surely only the start of the surprises before the season ends, and I hope that the rest will be presented in a better way.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-38545 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gotham-unleashed-300x169.jpg" alt="gotham-unleashed" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gotham-unleashed-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gotham-unleashed-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gotham-unleashed-298x167.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gotham-unleashed-620x348.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gotham-unleashed.jpg 970w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Gotham &#8211; Unleashed</span></strong></p>
<p>Some shows, when approaching the end of a season, crank up the excitement. <em>Gotham</em>, on the other hand, pours on the insanity. It ignores the fact that Gordon is not a cop and lets him run around doing anything he wants, thus proving again that this show is about Gordon and nothing else. But then it sticks him in a car driving through the city for most of the episode. It takes a villain who was absolutely bullet proof last week and allows him to be shot repeatedly in the chest. It then makes him stand stupidly while a team of bad guys shoots him with a rocket launcher while an action movie soundtrack plays. At least I got the rocket launcher that I expected last week. It proves the implication last week that Strange is going to create named villains by giving them a crazy personality. It throws another villain into the mix, who while unnamed is probably Killer Croc. Oddly, this is the only villain that I find acceptable to create in this way. So I&#8217;m sure that whenever he gets his reveal, it&#8217;ll ruin him and the sense of logic that could&#8217;ve been there. This episode also brought back Selina for no reason and gave her a new look. She&#8217;s still a worthless character, but at least she looks a little bit more like she actually lives on the street. As with all other <em>Gotham</em> episodes, a potential story arc is ended far too short. This show is more interested in introducing new elements than building an interesting story. It&#8217;s like the writers are just saying &#8220;Hey! Look what we can do!&#8221; without any intent to follow through or skill to do so. Compared to other episodes of <em>Gotham</em>, this one wasn&#8217;t terrible. But that&#8217;s not an acceptable excuse for the terrible quality that continues unchecked.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Supernatural &#8211; All in the Family<img class="size-medium wp-image-38546 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/supernatural-21-2-300x200.jpg" alt="supernatural-21-2" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/supernatural-21-2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/supernatural-21-2.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/supernatural-21-2-298x199.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span></p>
<p>Holy crap, Kevin! That was a squee-worthy moment. The reaction of the Winchesters to Chuck was perfect and exactly to character. Dean&#8217;s anger broke to reveal a desperate desire to understand, which casts his entire career these past eleven seasons in a more interesting perspective. Also interesting is the fact that these deities are much more like those of the Greek mythology. They are flawed. It makes sense given the context of the show but it&#8217;s also a little disappointing. I&#8217;ve always hoped that the Big Reveal would provide some hope instead of just more of the same. The addition of a new scribe is a little confusing. If divine power appoints a scribe, who shot that bolt of lightening? And what are those Chosen that Chuck mentioned? Will it be a hook for next season or will they show up in the final battle this season? Overall, this was a solid episode. It was focused on driving plot forward but it still delivered character development. Metatron&#8217;s choice was surprising, but just like with Dean, it revealed more about the truth of the character. Nothing was resolved in this episode, but it didn&#8217;t bother me. The chaos was controlled and it helped reinforce the desperate atmosphere of the story. At this point, my feeling is that success with come with a heavy cost and there will be some twist that leads into the opening danger of next season. But nothing yet has indicated exactly what&#8217;s going to happen. I hope the final result is worth the wait.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-38547 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ar421b_0328b2-300x200.jpg" alt="ar421b_0328b2" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ar421b_0328b2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ar421b_0328b2-768x513.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ar421b_0328b2-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ar421b_0328b2-620x414.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ar421b_0328b2.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arrow &#8211; Monument Point</strong></span></p>
<p>Why do all bunkers operated by super villains have a weird jumpsuit dress code? And that was pretty much the only source of humor in this very heavy episode. The urgent nature of the crisis was effectively supported during the entire episode. The action scenes were exciting. The most intense moment was resolution of the missile situation. I didn&#8217;t expect that. <em>Arrow</em> is usually very good about dealing with consequences, and I expect some nasty ones from this event. Beyond the impact on Felicity, this will most certainly have a major change on the world itself. Unless it just gets magicked away. This episode left me eagerly anticipating more, but there&#8217;s a sense of dread that other <em>Arrow</em> finales did not have. In the past, I was excited to see Team Arrow overcome the odds stacked against them. But this time, everything seems far more desperate and dangerous. This demonstrates that the writers know how to move forward with the characters and not just duplicate the same story over and over. This episode also briefly showed what happens when the bad guys team up. I&#8217;ve always said that I want Arrow to give birth to the TV version of the Justice League, and if the villains keep acting like this, it&#8217;s certainly more possible that Oliver will start to call in more favors.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Flash &#8211; The Runaway Dinosaur<img class="size-medium wp-image-38548 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flash-dinosaur-west-300x158.jpg" alt="flash-dinosaur-west" width="300" height="158" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flash-dinosaur-west-300x158.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flash-dinosaur-west-298x157.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flash-dinosaur-west-620x327.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flash-dinosaur-west.jpg 656w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span></p>
<p>The poor guy has gotten typecast as a zombie. And there was a nice meta joke about it too. But I was right about what happened to Barry. The process of him moving through the Speedforce and regaining his power was a little cliche, but it was handled very well. The zombie meta-human, however, was a silly diversion. Sure, it was entertaining, but it didn&#8217;t really serve a purpose other than keeping things exciting while Barry figured things out. Really, the best part of this episode was the dialogue and interactions between the entire cast. Everything was sharp and clever. I&#8217;m sure that this has something to do with the special guest director (even though his hand was not very apparent other than with that special guest spot) but I think more credit is due to the cast themselves. They clearly love these characters and enjoy their work on set. Their dynamic is what makes <em>Flash</em> consistently the best CW superhero show. It might be heavy on the drama at times, knows that the foundation of the goofy comic book genre is well-established characters that evolve and develop over time. The end of this episode was exciting. It seems to hint at a massive meta-human show down in the season finale, which would be awesome. <em>Flash</em> was the first show to embrace the spandex super hero concept, and seeing a huge brawl of supers would be really fun. That being said, I have a feeling that the show will find a way to bring the climax back to a showdown between only Flash and Zoom. Speaking of Zoom, Jay out of his mask is not a threatening villain. He is just a guy reading the bad guy part of the script. His reveal was a surprise, but he wasn&#8217;t given (or can&#8217;t deliver) enough  to support the role. And now that Zoom is simply a crazy dude on a revenge trip, he&#8217;s no-longer an interesting villain for the show. I&#8217;m looking forward to the conclusion of his story arc.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-38549 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lot-20115-300x200.jpg" alt="Destiny" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lot-20115-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lot-20115.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lot-20115-298x199.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Legends of Tomorrow &#8211; Destiny</strong></span></p>
<p>Woah woah woah. Did they just throw the Thanagar Invasion into the mix? Is that going to be the subject of next season? That&#8217;s potentially very huge, especially because this universe is shared with <em>Arrow</em> and <em>Flash</em>. However, it does also highlight the age-old confusion in the Hawk&#8217;s story line. This was a big, flashy episode with a lot of action. Legends handles that type of content very well. The biggest reaction to this episode is clearly who died in that final exploration. Sure, it was dramatic, but it was the wrong move. Snart was consistently one of the best parts of <em>Legends</em> and he gave the team a sense of logic that it desperately needed as a foundation. He was always the smartest guy in the room. I hope that <em>Legends</em> plays the &#8220;because comic books&#8221; card and brings him back at some point. Unfortunately, this moment also points out a glaring flaw in comic book logic. These characters have super powers and powerful futuristic weapons. There was absolutely no need to be in the room to blow up the computer. The only reason they were there was to facilitate the death of a character. That takes away any measure of heroism that the sacrifice play earned. Also, it forced the show to make a prop for the inside of a crazy time line controlling computer, and they did not do a great job. The show also made another huge mistake with Savage. Revealing that he was working with the Time Masters reduces him to nothing but a  a guy being sent to do things. He&#8217;s not the powerful immortal villain of of his comic book namesake. Yes, this is simply a different version of the character, just like every new comic book show and movie utilizes. But Savage was established early on as being very similar to the original concept. He was the immortal planner, playing the long game to reach his ends. Now, he&#8217;s just an errand boy used by a greater power to prepare for a greater threat. In my opinion, this ruined the character. Also, the show implies that he had to time travel back to kill Rip&#8217;s family. So he wasn&#8217;t there already working on taking over the world? Or was he in that point of time twice? That&#8217;s sloppy. I&#8217;m not sure how I fee about the whole &#8220;Time Masters have been engineering everything with a computer that either knows the future or creates it, it&#8217;s not really explained&#8221; deal. It&#8217;s a typical comic book plot device. It fits in fine with the nature of the show. It&#8217;s a great final act twist that gives the characters something to react to and deal with. But it also essentially negates everything that happened over the course of this first season. In the big picture, this isn&#8217;t a problem. It&#8217;s a very comic book move, and <em>Legends</em> is the most comic book show on the CW. But personally, I always wanted Legends to dig more into the philosophical debate over free will and destiny. So to me, this feels cheap. That being said, it was a great way to explain away a lot of the events of the season and open up the world for whatever happens next.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ll say it: Genevieve Valentine is one of the best authors writing today. She has that spark, that <em>je ne sais quoi</em> that brings both reality and mythology to life on the page, even for the shortest of stories. Here are three.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-38351" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/la-beaute-sans-vertu.jpg" alt="la-beaute-sans-vertu" width="185" height="278" />1. &#8220;<strong>La Beaute Sans Vertu&#8221;: Nothing But Gold Can Stay</strong></p>
<p>Do you like fashion? Do you like fairy tales? Do you like perfectly crafted metaphors that don&#8217;t feel like metaphors at all, but rather like the universe has conspired to tell us something profound about itself through the medium of story?</p>
<p>Right, then. &#8220;La Beaute Sans Vertu&#8221; is for you. Short and sharp, it&#8217;s a knife aimed at the fashion industry but also at fashion&#8217;s detractors. We all have heard that there&#8217;s no beauty without pain, but Valentine describes a world in which there&#8217;s no beauty without pains-taking either, the kind of masochistic impulses that can lead to self-mutilation, self-destruction&#8211;or self-transformation. Exactly which is which is for you to decide.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-38353" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/51u8wsXelkL._OU01_AC_UL320_SR214320_.jpg" alt="51u8wsXelkL._OU01_AC_UL320_SR214,320_" width="184" height="275" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/51u8wsXelkL._OU01_AC_UL320_SR214320_.jpg 214w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/51u8wsXelkL._OU01_AC_UL320_SR214320_-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px" />2. &#8220;<strong>The Insects of Love&#8221;: Swarm of Stars</strong></p>
<p>Fairuz is missing. Ever one to forge ahead, to determine her life&#8217;s course with the most steadfast resolve, she&#8217;s nevertheless gone off course. Soraya wants&#8211;needs&#8211;to find her wayward sister, but she&#8217;s no dauntless adventurer. She&#8217;s the shy one, more comfortable in front of her computer researching bugs. She wants smallness, fragility. She wants to protect those creatures without a voice who live on the brink of extinction, in whatever nooks they can be found.</p>
<p>Her sister wants vastness, and seeks deserts. First the ocean, where life can thrive but humans will wither in the salt and the emptiness. Then the traditional desert, all sand and tenuous, tenacious life. And finally the stars, strung in the vacuum of space where no life is possible&#8230;probably. Maybe. And maybe not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not quite the drug-induced haze that, say, Caitlin Kiernan or Mian Mian can produce, but it is mildly hallucinogenic. I can&#8217;t claim to understand this story. But because the writing is so good, the mere intimations of narrative are enough. It&#8217;s a waking dream.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-38352" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/51mijEGSp5L._SX331_BO1204203200_-200x300.jpg" alt="51mijEGSp5L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_" width="186" height="279" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/51mijEGSp5L._SX331_BO1204203200_-200x300.jpg 200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/51mijEGSp5L._SX331_BO1204203200_-298x447.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/51mijEGSp5L._SX331_BO1204203200_.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" />3. &#8220;<strong>Terrain&#8221;: Lonesome Prairie</strong></p>
<p>The saddest of the three stories by a long shot, and a piercing tale about that wretched illusion, &#8220;manifest destiny.&#8221; Faye and Frank are Shoshone on the run from Mormon missionaries and others who want to civilize them&#8211;or just erase them in order to erase their own guilt. They join up with Elijah on his &#8220;farm,&#8221; making a ragtag family with him and others who don&#8217;t fit into the settlers&#8217; WASPy world. Instead they run spiders, the &#8220;dogs&#8221; with legs that can climb the rocky peaks that even the pony express doesn&#8217;t dare. But then the railroad comes, and immanent domain.</p>
<p>If injustice makes you angry, give yourself time after you finish this. It&#8217;s a tough one but it does thirty-six very solid pages&#8217; worth of work to roll back that rosy glow we cast all over the old west, forgetting what atrocities were committed there.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8216;Tis the season for family reunions, fa la la la la la</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This recap obviously contains spoilers from Season 6 Episode 4.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;">      <img class="aligncenter" src="http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57392fe78e32eeb03937897e/master/w_690,c_limit/sansa-jon-hug.gif" alt="" width="828" height="461" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Jon is getting his stuff together in preparation to leave Castle Black. Edd reminds him that the real war is coming and chastises Jon for deciding to leave when he is needed the most. Jon reminds him that his own brothers killed him and he cannot stay there after what happened &#8211; he pledged his life to the Night&#8217;s Watch and he gave his life for it. Right then, there is a sharp blast from a horn, just one blast though; more than one blast means it&#8217;s wildlings or white walkers. The gates to Castle Black open and in trot Sansa, Brienne, and Pod. Tormund is instantly captivated by Brienne. Jon and Sansa see each other after a long ass time &#8211; each is the only family the other has seen in so long. They hug each other and I cried. Jon and Sansa reminisce about their lives in Winterfell and Sansa apologizes for being terrible to Jon when she was younger. Sansa asks Jon where he will go and he says they will go wherever, together. Sansa makes a case for Winterfell and taking it back from the Boltons but Jon is so tired of fighting and killing. Sansa reminds him that as long as the Boltons have the North, they will never be safe. She wants Jon&#8217;s help but she&#8217;ll try to do it on her own if he&#8217;s not willing to help.</p>
<div style="width: 739px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://0.media.dorkly.cvcdn.com/20/36/7082c8e9700db2d7acef8f4560a06357.gif" alt="" width="729" height="362" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;She&#8217;s as big as a bear&#8230;&#8221;</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Melisandre now follows Jon because he is the Prince that was Promised. Davos is like &#8220;umm&#8230;that&#8217;s totally what you said about Stannis, too&#8221; and asks her what actually happened during the battle that led to Stannis&#8217; death, especially what happened with Shireen. Brienne walks up to them and tells them that right before she executed Stanis, he admitted to using blood magic to kill Renly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-38521 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GOTAidan_Gillen_as_Littlefinger-TV-large_transLYdoWXVyVUQMSe0gNN2ScOStlGnC5KO0sAXT5wQDEkg-300x187.jpg" alt="GOTAidan_Gillen_as_Littlefinger-TV-large_trans++LYdoWXVyVUQMSe0gNN2ScOStlGnC5KO0sAXT5wQDEkg" width="788" height="491" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GOTAidan_Gillen_as_Littlefinger-TV-large_transLYdoWXVyVUQMSe0gNN2ScOStlGnC5KO0sAXT5wQDEkg-300x187.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GOTAidan_Gillen_as_Littlefinger-TV-large_transLYdoWXVyVUQMSe0gNN2ScOStlGnC5KO0sAXT5wQDEkg-298x186.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GOTAidan_Gillen_as_Littlefinger-TV-large_transLYdoWXVyVUQMSe0gNN2ScOStlGnC5KO0sAXT5wQDEkg-620x387.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GOTAidan_Gillen_as_Littlefinger-TV-large_transLYdoWXVyVUQMSe0gNN2ScOStlGnC5KO0sAXT5wQDEkg.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Man, sweet Robin is still terrible at life and can&#8217;t shoot an arrow right to save his life. Petyr is back in the Vale with a gift for Robin: a falcon. Lord Yohn Royce tries to confront Petyr about Sansa&#8217;s marriage to Ramsay but Petyr turns it around on Royce by saying Petyr only told Royce about the details of their trip but, somehow, the Boltons heard about their plans, stopped them, and took Sansa away with them. Since Royce was the only one in the know, clearly Royce must have notified the Boltons. Robin is quiet ready to make Royce fly, but Petyr convinces Robin to give him another chance on the condition of his absolute loyalty. Petyr also manages to gently lead Robin into pledging to come to Sansa&#8217;s aid.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-38516 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4500-300x180.jpg" alt="4500" width="848" height="509" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4500-300x180.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4500-298x179.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4500.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tyrion has invited the representatives of Yukai, Astapor, and Volantis to come speak with him. Missandei and Grey Worm are not about that life &#8211; they want to use force not diplomacy. Tyrion tells them &#8220;you make peace with your enemies, not your friends.&#8221; He also reminds them he himself had been a slave for a whole day so he totally gets it, but Missandei tells him he <em>knows</em> about slavery but he does not actually <em>understand</em> slavery. Tension is high at the meeting with the representatives &#8211; the representatives, Missandei, and Grey Worm exchanging heated words. Tyrion tries to calm them down and sets forth his proposal: Meereen will never have slaves, but the rest of the cities will get a period of seven years to phase out slavery. The slave owners will get money for the slaves they will be losing at a price that they will set. In return, the Masters will stop funding the Sons of the Harpy. When the representatives protest saying they don&#8217;t fund them, Tyrion says, &#8220;okay okay but you stop funding them anyway.&#8221; And as a thank you, Tyrion gifts them each a lady.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38529 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Trailer_2_00.13-300x169.jpg" alt="Trailer_2_00.13" width="818" height="461" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Trailer_2_00.13-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Trailer_2_00.13-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Trailer_2_00.13-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Trailer_2_00.13-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Trailer_2_00.13.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 818px) 100vw, 818px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The freed slaves of Meereen are not happy about Tyrion wining and dining the representatives of the Masters, nor do they trust Tyrion to tell them why he did it. They instead ask Grey Worm and Missandei whether they agree with what Tyrion is doing. Both grudgingly say they do and that they should give the peace treaty a chance. This doesn&#8217;t mean that the two believe in Tyrion&#8217;s plans. They have a hard time grasping Tyrion&#8217;s plan and vice versa, because neither side really knows what the other knows. Missandei and Grey Worm actually know and understand what it&#8217;s like to be a slave and, therefore, see the seven years phasing-out period to still be a long time for a slave. It&#8217;s better to free the slaves now, whether it means using force. Tyrion, however, knows that people like the Masters won&#8217;t do something unless it&#8217;s in their interest, and getting paid for the freed slaves at a price they set is definitely in their interest. It&#8217;s seven years but it&#8217;s better for the long term goal of getting the slaves freed. Even though Tyrion assures them that he does not trust the Masters, Grey Worm warns him that the Masters will use Tyrion for their own good.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-38528 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jorah-and-daario-track-daenerys-to-vaes-dothrak-300x200.jpg" alt="jorah-and-daario-track-daenerys-to-vaes-dothrak" width="842" height="561" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jorah-and-daario-track-daenerys-to-vaes-dothrak-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jorah-and-daario-track-daenerys-to-vaes-dothrak-768x511.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jorah-and-daario-track-daenerys-to-vaes-dothrak-298x198.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jorah-and-daario-track-daenerys-to-vaes-dothrak-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jorah-and-daario-track-daenerys-to-vaes-dothrak.jpg 930w" sizes="(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Jorah and Daario are trekking through the land, headed to Vaes Dothrak. It&#8217;s like so hot and they&#8217;re hiking/walking, they should&#8217;ve definitely taken their shirts off. Just sayin&#8217;. Greyscale must be taking a toll on Jorah, he seems a little worse for wear. Daario takes note of Jorah&#8217;s fatigue and jokes that Jorah definitely could not handle Dany in bed because Daario can barely handle her sometimes. Daario is just antagonizing Jorah, but he doesn&#8217;t actually want to fight him. They&#8217;ve finally made it to Vaes Dothrak, but because weapons are not allowed in Vaes Dothrak, they must leave all of their weapons and pretend to be traders instead. When Jorah holds his hand out for Daario&#8217;s knife, he sees the greyscale on Jorah&#8217;s hand. Inside Vaes Dothrak, it&#8217;s your usual Dothakri party with drinking, fighting, and fucking. They come across two dudes and try to play like they&#8217;re traders, but the dudes do not believe them. Daario takes off after the guy who ran to raise the alarm and takes care of him, while Jorah is having a real hard time fighting off the other dude. Seems like the other dude is going to off Jorah, but Daario stabs him with his knife with a lady-shaped handle. Leaving a body with a stab wound will raise questions and alarm, so Daario smashes the dude&#8217;s head with a huge rock a bunch of times &#8211; way more than necessary, IMO.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38517 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dany-300x200.jpg" alt="dany" width="812" height="541" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dany-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dany-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dany-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dany-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dany.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Inside the Dosh Khaleen, the crones are hanging out and the main crone is telling Dany how some Dothraki don&#8217;t think they should marry outside their tribe but don&#8217;t realize that their own blood is diluted. She also tells Dany that she better hope that she is allowed in because otherwise her fate would be waaaay worse. Dany makes the excuse of having to pee to go get some air. She is escorted by a young Khaleesi &#8211; they talk a little and Dany laments that the other Khaleesi&#8217;s husband didn&#8217;t die sooner than he did. When they&#8217;re a good distance from the buildings, Daario and Jorah burst from the shadows and Daario subdues the other Khaleesi&#8217;s screams. Dany tells them to chill because she got other plans, bros!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38519 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/game-of-thrones-season-6-episode-4-c-300x169.jpg" alt="game-of-thrones-season-6-episode-4-c" width="813" height="458" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/game-of-thrones-season-6-episode-4-c-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/game-of-thrones-season-6-episode-4-c-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/game-of-thrones-season-6-episode-4-c-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/game-of-thrones-season-6-episode-4-c.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There&#8217;s a huge bug in Margaery&#8217;s cell but she is beyond caring. Septa Unella takes her to the High Sparrow, who, after being impressed by hew knowledge of the <em>Book of the Stranger</em>, tells her a tale about his own life, one in which he was vain and materialistic. He tells her about waking up one morning after a particularly raucous, indulgent party and realizing that the life he was living was wrong. He left his old life and started a new, religious one. Okay so, if you want to be super religious and pious, that&#8217;s your deal but trying to get everyone else to conform to what you think life should entail is real terrible. You are Judgy McJudgeface and I hate you. After telling Marg this story, he takes her to see Loras, who is beaten and bruised. He is so ready to give up because he just wants this terrible saga to end, but Marg tries to talk him into being strong. We will see if that will work.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38523 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/olenna-300x224.jpg" alt="olenna" width="852" height="636" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/olenna-300x224.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/olenna-768x572.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/olenna-298x222.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/olenna-620x462.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/olenna.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Grand Maester Pycelle is attempting to counsel Tommen, when Cersei walks in and shoos him away. Tommen is so nervous about the High Sparrow &#8211; he thinks they need to be careful with him and be delicate with what they plan to do. Cersei reminds him of the way she was treated at the hands of the High Sparrow and uses his love for Marg to convince Tommen that the High Sparrow doesn&#8217;t respect anyone. Tommen tells Cersei a secret that the High Sparrow shared with him, and Cersei goes straight to the Small Council meeting with it. Initially, Kevan and Olenna are like &#8220;not this shit again,&#8221; but Cersei gets them to listen. She relays to them the secret Tommen heard from the High Sparrow: Marg was to make the walk of atonement. Olenna is like OH HELL NO. Kevan&#8217;s hands are tied as Tommen has told the Lannister and Baratheon armies to stand down, but Jaime has another plan. How about the Tyrell army marches on King&#8217;s Landing, defeats the Faith Militant, and reads the <em>Book of the Stranger</em> to the High Sparrow aka finishes him? That way, it won&#8217;t seem like the King sanctioned the fight and the result will still be what they want: the defeat of the High Sparrow. Kevan is finally persuaded when Cersei reminds him of his own son, Lancel. There might be a civil war as a result and deaths for sure, but as Olenna puts it, &#8220;better them than us&#8221;. Dat <em>Rains of Castamere</em> in the background.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Theon is finally back in Pyke and walks into the castle, where he finds a glum Yara. She is mad at him for being the way he is, for causing the deaths of her men in his botched rescue attempt. She knows he is broken, but now wants to know why he is back. He is not there for the King&#8217;s Moot &#8211; he is there to help her be the ruler of the Iron Islands.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ramsay summons Osha and seems to be amused by the conversation they have: she asks if they eat the people they flay, he says no, and she says she&#8217;s seen worse. Her lie about protecting Rickon in order to sell him to the right buyer seems to be working. He seems to be turned on by her seductive ways, tells her she&#8217;s a way better conversationalist than Theon. The whole time she is trying to grab the knife on the table. BUT, Theon did have useful things he told Ramsay &#8211; like the truth about Bran and Rickon and who helped them escape. Right then, she grabs a hold of the knife but, of course, killing Ramsay can&#8217;t be THIS easy. So, Ramsay stabs her in the neck instead and she bleeds to death. RIP Tonks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57392fce84cb4922586cdce7/master/w_690,c_limit/brienne-tormund-2.gif" alt="" width="912" height="514" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Guess who is crushing hard on Brienne? Tormund, that&#8217;s who. If a boy looked at me the way he was looking at Brienne while he bit into that piece of bread&#8230;*swoon*. Edd apologizes for the quality of food at the Wall, but Sansa doesn&#8217;t mind, which is a testament to how far she has come as a person. A letter arrives for the Lord Commander; Jon says he&#8217;s not the Lord Commander anymore but takes the letter regardless. It&#8217;s from Ramsay, saying that he has Rickon and his dead direwolf, and that he wants his wife back. If he doesn&#8217;t get what he wants, he threatens to ride North, attack Castle Black, and&#8230;Jon can&#8217;t read anymore, but Sansa takes the letter and reads the rest of the terribleness. The letter is signed &#8220;Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North,&#8221; and this does not sit well with Jon. Sansa knows that if Ramsay is the Lord of Winterfell, that must mean that he killed Roose. Even with the wildlings, they don&#8217;t have the numbers to match the Boltons. Sansa urges Jon to face the truth: Ramsay has Rickon and the North, and they need to go get both back. Jon finally relents and agrees.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">During the Khalar Vezhven, where the Khals make their important decisions, Khal Maro decides not to do anything about finding the killer of the dude Daario smashed up. Dany is brought before them and they start arguing about what to do with her but she interjects, asking if they want to know what she thinks. She reminds them that in the same temple that they were all in, Khal Drogo promised to go to Westeros and retake the Iron Throne, but what had the current Khals been doing instead &#8211; raiding and pillaging? She tells them that they are all small men, not worthy of leading the Dothrakis, but you know who is? DAENERYS FUCKIN&#8217; TARGARYEN. She then knocks over the braziers, which lights the temple on fire. The men try to scramble to the door but it&#8217;s blocked from the outside. Outside, the Dothrakis gather around the burning temple and, after the door burns down, they see Dany emerge from the flames, unscathed. They all bow down to her (including the people seeing the back of the temple and have no idea what the heck is going on up front). Oh, Jorah and Daario also bow down.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wheel of Time turns, and TV adaptations come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the TV adaptation that gave it birth comes once again. In an age called 2016, another proposed adaptation came to pass.  This was not the beginning or the ending to the turning of the Wheel. But it was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Jordan’s fantasy epic </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> holds a treasured (if sometimes angsty) place in the hearts of many fantasy fans. Throughout the ages it has caused us joy, consternation, anger, and boredom in turns but most of it’s fans still fiercely love it. I am one of those people. I know that sometimes it’s a sprawling mess, and I almost never recommend it to people, but it has a special place in my heart and bookshelf. And I am here to tell you why it should never be a TV show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 29, 2016, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Google+ page (yes, you read that right) announced that a new series was in the works and that the previous legal issues had been sorted (more on that in a bit). This note came signed by Harriet McDougal, the widow of Robert Jordan and general master of anything </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that has happened since his death. As you can imagine, people have been clamouring for a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show ever since the books started coming out, with the fervour only building after the insane success of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There have been multiple proposed shows, the first was a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eye of the World</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the first book) miniseries back in 2000. Then that faded away. Those rights were later optioned as a movie in 2008 but never got far. And that brings us to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winter Dragon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winter Dragon </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">premiered on FXX at 1:30AM with no warning or notice. It was a rough 20 minute “pilot” for a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wheel of Time </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">show made by Red Eagle Entertainment that showed parts of the prologue to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eye of the World</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Quality wise it has&#8230;issues. It’s not terrible, but it’s not great.  For some reason Billy Zane was cast as Ishamael, and he reads his lines with all the intensity of a man making a shopping list. Pronunciations are inconsistent throughout the 20 minute episode and the CG is terrible. I will admit it captured some of the feel of the book and the prologue, and the madness that came to Lews Therin. But honestly, none of that matters aside from one very important fact: it was made without the knowledge of Harriet. She made the following statement:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This morning brought startling news. A &#8220;pilot&#8221; for a Wheel of Time series, the &#8220;pilot&#8221; being called Winter Dragon, had appeared at 1:30 in the morning, East Coast time, on FXX TV, a channel somewhere in the 700s (founded to concentrate on comedy, according to the Washington Post).</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was made without my knowledge or cooperation. I never saw the script. No one associated with Bandersnatch Group, the successor-in-interest to James O. Rigney, was aware of this.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bandersnatch has an existing contract with Universal Pictures that grants television rights to them until this Wednesday, February 11 – at which point these rights revert to Bandersnatch.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see no mention of Universal in the &#8220;pilot&#8221;. Nor, I repeat, was Bandersnatch, or Robert Jordan&#8217;s estate, informed of this in any way.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am dumbfounded by this occurrence, and am taking steps to prevent its reoccurrence.&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-via Ta’Veren Tees</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fact alone was enough to alienate most </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fans, because you do not cross Harriet. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winter Dragon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was likely produced and pushed out at the last minute because Red Eagle was about to lose the rights, but Harriet’s comments triggered a lawsuit that wasn’t resolved for another few months. Great, everything is resolved! And here’s where I tell you why it’s never going to happen.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is massive. There are fourteen books, and each of them is between 250,000 and 400,000 words for a full count of 4,410,036 words. For a slightly less obscure metric, the audiobook of the shortest </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> book (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Path of Daggers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is twenty three hours and thirty one minutes. The longest (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Memory of Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) clocks in at a massive forty one hours and fifty five minutes. So let’s say that this show happens, and we go the “one book, one season” route, because in the first place it would be incredibly hard to compress more than that. That means to go through the entire series run you need fourteen seasons. Now if you can name me a show that maintained its goodness and integrity through enough time to raise a child to puberty, please enlighten me, because it’s a unicorn. And that’s saying that the show even gets through all fourteen seasons, keeps its viewers loving and guessing and theorizing for minimum fourteen years.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as I love </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I’ll be the first to admit that the story is far from compelling at times. Now the same argument could be made for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but I’ll say that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has one very important thing going for it that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not: intrigue.  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a political intrigue show set in a fantasy world. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is your standard hero’s journey in a fantasy world. It has some intrigue, but later and lighter than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s just not interesting enough to non fantasy fans.  I’m sorry, but it’s true. When </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> originally aired, I told people that “It’s the Sopranos in Middle Earth” and while I wasn’t exactly correct, it was enough to get non fantasy fans interested. But if people asked me what a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show was about, I’d have a hard time saying anything that was enough to get people who don’t watch fantasy interested. Hell, I can’t get people to read the books half the time. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is too much of a behemoth for it’s own good sometimes. But that’s okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of whether it can, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doesn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">need</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be a TV show. I think even the most die hard fan would admit that nothing on the screen could ever match the majesty of what the book puts in our heads. No Aes Sedai could be as cool, no Forsaken as terrifying, no Nynaeve sniff as infuriating. The true magic of</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Wheel of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lies in its ability to enchant, transport, and inspire, and no TV show could ever do it half as well. There are no endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time, but this is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">an</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ending.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-38488 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/civil-war.jpg" alt="civil war" width="752" height="436" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/civil-war.jpg 655w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/civil-war-300x174.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/civil-war-298x173.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/civil-war-620x360.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" /></p>
<p>Marvel’s 2006 Civil War comic book storyline was, at the time, a critically divisive work and yet, a commercial success. Retrospectively, the whole thing comes across as kind of stupid. Civil War was an exciting, brutal, incoherent mess; an action story with not much heart, full of an enormous cast that seem to obey no logical thought. So, does the latest Captain America outing manage to rise above its comic book namesake? Is Tony Stark still shadowed by strange fascist undertones? Does Captain America make terrible decisions then continue stick by them for no apparent reason? Is the reason for the civil war just as loose and tenuous? Well, this is one of those times where the film is far, far better than the book.</p>
<p>Spinning almost directly out of the events in Sokovia in <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>, <em>Civil War</em> asks the classic philosophical question &#8216;how would the world react if a team of superheroes dropped a city on an eastern European nation?&#8217; Not well as it turns out, with the Avengers issued an ultimatum by the United Nations to &#8220;come under our control or else&#8221;. The Russo brothers&#8217; story feels very much like <em>The Winter Soldier</em>. A large scale action adventure with espionage and political elements and just the right amount of character focused questions. It has the potential to be a dreary slug fest, but they keep the film on its proverbial toes. Just as it starts to slow down, the story kicks of once more and escalates. It’s mightily predictable, but incredibly satisfying.</p>
<p>What is particularly satisfying however is the proverbial &#8216;civil war&#8217; itself, the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man. One of my real problems with the comic is that both heroes are presented in a kind of ideological split. Despite being friends, there is no real reconciliation between the two because their ideas and beliefs are too different. They must, at a fundamental level, fight each other, which I find bizarre and sort of fatalistic. <em>Civil War </em>however opts for a far less morose conflict with both characters forced to fight by necessity, outside forces and with great regret. It’s only at the very end of the film that there is real anger-driven fighting, and thanks to the rest of the films strong story, it feels perfectly natural.</p>
<p>The action is like-wise, with scene after scene flowing smoothly and fluidly across the screen and car chases to fist fights all being easy to follow. Without giving too much away, a certain scene at an airport is hands down one of the best, most spectacularly choreographed fight scenes in a comic book movie ever. Too often, an action film can be let down by the relentless pacing or poor camera work of its action sequences, but the Russo brothers let them breathe and put real care into the overall progression of them. It makes for a film that is not only exciting, but actually coherent.</p>
<p>Every actor in the cast is in fine form with particular mention to Robert Downy Jr. as an incredibly conflicted Iron Man. I also have to commend Tom Holland as Spiderman. In fact, I have to commend the whole film for creating the best cinematic version of Spiderman to date. Spiderman to me is young, inexperienced, has a bit of wit to him whilst also being the most awkward hero in the group. And <em>Civil War </em>nails it, making me monumentally excited for <em>Spiderman: Homecoming</em>.</p>
<p><em>Civil War </em>is, above all, fun. There is a certain goofiness to seeing Iron Man and Captain America flanked by their friends about to do battle. But the film really embraces that goofiness, without sacrificing any of its story and it makes for an action packed superhero romp that is not to be missed.</p>
<p>5 Stars.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DC Comics is reinventing itself yet again, relaunching all its titles and bringing in some fresh creative teams. Last week we had <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/dc-rebirth-run-down-batman/">a look at all the new Batman books</a> that would be launching. Some were interesting, others less so.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-38273" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Banner.png" alt="Banner" width="874" height="492" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Banner.png 800w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Banner-300x169.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Banner-768x432.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Banner-298x168.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Banner-620x349.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px" /></strong></p>
<p>But what about Superman? DC’s oldest and possibly most recognizable property is also given the rebirth treatment with seven Superman related titles launching later this year, including <em>Action Comics </em>returning to its original numbering with #957. We’ll also be looking at the new <em>Wonder Woman</em> because she only has one series, alas. First up, <em>Superman</em>.</p>

<h2><strong>Superman (Twice Monthly)</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Writer:</em></strong><em> Peter J. Tomasi<br />
</em><strong><em>Artist:</em></strong><em> Patrick Gleason<br />
</em><strong><em>Rebirth One Shot?: </em></strong>Sure is, Peter J. Tomasi teams up with veteran <em>Green Lantern </em>artist Doug Mahnke to bring the rebirth issue to life.</p>
<div id="attachment_38275" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-38275" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Superman-Rebirth-842x1200.jpg" alt="Superman: Rebirth- On Sale June 1st" width="620" height="884" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Superman-Rebirth-842x1200.jpg 842w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Superman-Rebirth-211x300.jpg 211w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Superman-Rebirth-768x1094.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Superman-Rebirth-298x425.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Superman-Rebirth-620x883.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Superman-Rebirth.jpg 1053w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Superman: Rebirth- On Sale June 1st</p></div>
<p><strong><em><br />
The Creative Team: </em></strong>An editor at DC for 15 years and a writer since 2007, Peter J. Tomasi is no stranger to DC’s characters. Kicking his career off with a celebrated miniseries on anti-hero/god Black Adam, Tomasi started well. He continued well, if under the radar, with a few limited runs on <em>Nightwing, Requiem </em>and <em>Batman and Robin</em>. But it was in 2004, three years before he joined DC as a full time writer that he really made his mark with the critically acclaimed <em>Light Brigade</em>. Praised highly for its historical accuracies, fantastic characters and compelling story, <em>Light Brigade</em> was a sleeper hit for Tomasi well before working on established properties. What makes Tomasi a writer worth checking out is his great run on <em>Green Lantern Corps </em>during Geoff John’s mega event <em>Blackest Night</em> and continuing on post New 52. Now I don’t want to point fingers or go on too much, but there is a reason that <em>Green Lantern Corps</em> was eventually cancelled after Tomasi left. Spoiler: it sucked super hard.</p>
<p>Patrick Gleason is also a name that I’m familiar with, at least visually. His work on <em>Green Lantern Corps </em>with Peter J. Tomasi was roundly celebrated. While I would love to segue into how Gleason started his career, I honestly can’t tell. He seems to have had a skillful hand in nearly every Batman and Robin book for the last ten years, culminating in a critically acclaimed run on the series in the New 52. In addition to that he’s also had a short run on <em>Nightwing</em> and also on <em>Brightest Day </em>(with Peter J. Tomasi, of course).</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-38276" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gleason-1.jpg" alt="Gleason 1" width="350" height="531" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gleason-1.jpg 659w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gleason-1-198x300.jpg 198w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gleason-1-298x452.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gleason-1-620x941.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" />         <img class="alignnone wp-image-38277" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gleason-2.jpg" alt="Gleason 2" width="350" height="532" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gleason-2.jpg 658w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gleason-2-197x300.jpg 197w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gleason-2-298x453.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gleason-2-620x942.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </em></strong>Superman is a hell of a property, Superman is a cultural icon. And I honestly think that Tomasi is the right writer for the next series of <em>Superman</em>. This new <em>Superman </em>comes with one key difference over the other titles being launched; in this version, Superman is a super family-man. The man of steel finds himself having to balance the difficulties of being a father and husband with being superhero. A classic story, but one that hasn’t been told with Superman in a long time. The quality of this comic, regardless of the team behind it, depends entirely on your openness to the idea of Super-dad. I for one think that if you’re a fan of Superman, this is a great jumping on point. Tomasi and Gleason are both accomplished and have worked together extensively. If you’re looking for traditional superhero fare, perhaps look elsewhere.</p>

<h2><strong>New Superman</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Writer: </em></strong>Gene Luen Yang<br />
<strong><em>Artist: </em></strong>Viktor Bogdanovic<br />
<strong><em>Rebirth One Shot?: </em></strong>No sir, <em>New Superman</em> is new. No need for a rebirth here.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Creative Team: </em></strong>While I am not a huge Superman fan, this is a book I’m excited about just based on the writer. Gene Luen Yang is the author of two of my favorite indie comics, <em>American Born Chinese </em>and <em>Level Up</em>. Both are stellar examples of not only compelling stories, but stories with heart. <em>American Born Chinese </em>in particular was critically acclaimed and won the Michael L. Printz Award. Yang also wrote a large portion of the <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender </em>comics, which were also well received. And if that wasn’t enough, he flexed his historical and philosophical muscles with <em>Boxers/</em>Saints, a historical comic about the Chinese Boxer Rebellion. Basically what I’m saying here is that, while Yang may have only ever written 9 issues of <em>Superman</em>, he is a fantastic writer in other genres and formats and pretty much anything he sets his pen to is likely to be good.</p>
<p>Viktor Bogdanovic is an artist that is fairly new to the scene, having only really done the art for the <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em> tie-in series and a couple issues of <em>Suicide Squad Most Wanted: Deadshot</em>. Despite his inexperience, Bogdanovic was congratulated for his work on <em>Arkham Knight, </em>and <em>New Superman </em>may be his break-out title.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-38308" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-1-199x300.jpg" alt="viktor 1" width="350" height="527" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-1-199x300.jpg 199w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-1-768x1157.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-1-796x1200.jpg 796w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-1-298x449.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-1-620x934.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" />          <img class="alignnone wp-image-38309" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-2-199x300.jpg" alt="viktor 2" width="350" height="527" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-2-199x300.jpg 199w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-2-768x1157.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-2-796x1200.jpg 796w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-2-298x449.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-2-620x934.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viktor-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What Is It About, and Is It Worth It?: </em></strong><em>New Superman</em> is indeed new, in that Superman is not Clark Kent, but is Kenan Kong, a Chinese Superman. I’m looking forward to Yang’s take on this character as its obvious he has the skill to do so. He’s also placed a lot of thought into the background, even going so far as to change the name after writing the script for the first issue. The writing will undoubtedly be solid. An inexperienced artist with an experienced writer isn’t always the best combination though, with a strong story let down by poor art. However, I feel confident that Bogdanovic will pull through. He’s had solid work since he’s started and Yang has a history of getting good work out of his artists. If you’re looking for a smart, well written Superman story with a difference, acquire day one.</p>

<h2><strong>Superwoman</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Writer: </em></strong>Phil Jimenez<br />
<strong><em>Artist: </em></strong>Also Phil Jimenez<br />
<strong><em>Rebirth One Shot?: </em></strong>Much like <em>New Superman</em>, <em>Superwoman </em>is a brand new series, so no rebirth issue here.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Creative Team:</em></strong> Before now, I was unsure who Phil Jimenez was. Now I’m wondering how I’ve never heard of him before. The man seems to be a drawing dynamo. Starting with DC in 1991, Jiminez came to the fore as an artist on DC’s mega event <em>Infinite Crisis</em>, which received mixed reactions in terms of story, but was praised for its art. Jiminez has also worked on a 3 year run of <em>Wonder Woman</em> and even collaborated with Grant Morrison on <em>New X-Men </em>and <em>The Invisibles</em>. He went on to draw for over 40 different series for DC, Image, Vertigo and Marvel. As an artist, Jimenez is incredibly experienced and looking at his work, it shows. As a writer I feel less confident. Jiminez just has less experience as a writer. What experience he does have is hardly the Eisner winning stuff of legends. In 1994, Jiminez wrote a well-received mini-series, <em>Tempest</em>, which was a good starting point. But the only other significant project he’s penned is a mini-series for Vertigo, <em>Otherworld, </em>which wasn’t terrible, but was still labelled confusing at best.</p>

<p><strong><em>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </em></strong>While it would seem obvious what this comic is about based on the name, there’s a little more to it. For reasons that I’m not 100% familiar with, Superman has lost his powers and transferred them to none other than Lois Lane. Jiminez promises a story of Lois struggling to adjust to her new powers, and a search to find out why they’re killing her. I’m intrigued by the concept and I’m almost certain it’ll look fantastic, but I just can’t help but think that Jiminez may not have the experience to pull it off. Perhaps <em>Superwoman </em>will prove me wrong and we’ll get the woman-centric superhero tale we’ve been promised. I certainly hope so, as it seems to be the kind of series that could be truly excellent.</p>

<h2><strong>Supergirl</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Writer: </em></strong>Steve Orlando<br />
<strong><em>Artist: </em></strong>Brian Ching<br />
<strong><em>Rebirth One Shot?: </em></strong>Surely is, Steve Orlando and Emanuela Lupacchino team up to bring the new <em>Supergirl </em>to life on August 17th (No cover as of yet)</p>
<p><strong><em>The Creative Team</em></strong>: Steve Orlando is a writer that I’m in two minds about. Orlando really started back in 2009, contributing stories for a variety of different anthologies for Vertigo and Image. After a solo series we’ll get to a little bit, Orlando moved onto <em>Midnighter</em>, a Batman-esqu character who also happened to be gay. The series was a critical success with the series noted for its strong character relationships and well-developed arcs. Now it would seem, thanks to his hard work and success on <em>Midnighter</em>, Orlando has been given the chance to work on <em>Supergirl</em>, a title he will no doubt bring the same level of skill to. That ‘other series’ I mentioned? That series is <em>Undertow —</em> a pulpy, atlantean-themed sci-fi romp that, by all accounts and reviews, is fantastic. Called a tense thrill ride by some and a unique take on an old concept by others. I hated it. I couldn’t stand the damn thing and only got 3 issues in. So, two minds here. On the one hand, a brilliantly received series that won awards for its portrayal of a gay character, and on the other a series that remains to this day the only one I have ever cancelled prematurely.</p>
<p>Brian Ching, unlike Steve Orlando, seems to come from a wealth of experience. While I can’t pinpoint his exact start, Ching has been involved as an artist for Dark Horse since 2005, providing pencils for a range of <em>Star Wars </em>comics ever since. This seems to make up the body of his work with his pencils appearing in over 20 different Star Wars titles. He has also worked on a few series that would be considered outside the mainstream (at least compared to <em>Superman</em>), such as <em>Witchblade, Conan The Avenger,</em> and a variety of <em>Conan </em>one shots. Brian Ching has quite a distinctive style, and it remains to be seen if it can brought into <em>Supergirl</em>, a title that is quite unlike anything else he’s drawn.</p>

<p><strong><em>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </em></strong>In the New 52, <em>Supergirl </em>sold and was received fairly well until it was cancelled for reasons that I’m still not 100% sure on despite my extensive research (internet browsing). So the prospect of a new <em>Supergirl </em>series, especially this close to the television series, could be an exciting one. The team is solid with Ching having a bevy of work behind him and Orlando having a small but well received range behind him. No real, concrete details are available yet as to the actual story, though expect some similarities to the TV show with Supergirl having to handle moving to a new city. Oh, and her Dad is the Cyborg Superman apparently, because y’know why the heck not right? There’s real potential here for a great series, but I’ll just never be able to get the taste of <em>Undertow </em>out of my mouth.</p>

<h2><strong>Action Comics (Twice Monthly)</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Writer: </em></strong>Dan Jurgens<br />
<strong><em>Artist: </em></strong>Patrick Zircher, Tyler Kirkham and Stephen Segovia<br />
<strong><em>Rebirth One Shot?: </em></strong>No sir, <em>Action Comics </em>leaps straight back to it with #957.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Creative Team: </em></strong>Dan Jurgens was a name that we covered over in <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/dc-rebirth-run-down-batman/">the Batman article</a>, seeing as he is to stay on as the writer for <em>Batman Beyond</em>. In case you missed last time, the short and tall of it is that he’s generally regarded as a great writer. I expressed a little hesitation though, as his run on <em>Batman Beyond </em>in the last year or so had not exactly been met with the biggest enthusiasm with some reviewers, who said his story felt confused or lacked direction. While I would still keep a little bit of that skepticism around, Jurgens does have a huge involvement with Superman related titles, having written for the character since the 1980’s. He was even one of the main forces behind <em>The Death of Superman </em>and created two of Superman’s deadliest villains, Doomsday (who actually did kill Superman) and Cyborg Superman (who was less successful). So Dan Jurgens is a writer is who has a lot of Superman experience, but perhaps shouldn’t be on a Batman title.</p>
<p>In terms of artists, this one is a little confusing. I’ve never really been that sure on the need for multiple artists, and I’m certainly not going to cover the careers of three different artists here. However, looking at Patrick Zircher, Tyler Kirkham and Stephen Segovia, I’m encouraged. Patrick Zircher, I’m guessing, will be the lead artist, with a wealth of DC and Marvel experience behind him. Tyler Kirkham has also worked for DC extensively, being the main artist on <em>Green Lantern: New Guardians</em> and providing covers and supporting art for a variety of other series. Stephen Segovia seems to be about on the same level as Kirkham, having done the pencils for a wide range of Marvel titles and titles I’ve never even heard of. So a varied, but experienced, art team.</p>
<p><em><strong>Patrick Zircher</strong></em><br />

<p><strong><em>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </em></strong>Look, I’m not 100% clear on my Superman lore, I never have been, so forgive me if I sound confused here. Best I can tell, <em>Action Comics</em> will have two Supermen, as well as Lex Luthor who is also Superman. One Superman is from the New 52, while the other is the classic Superman with a wife and child (who you can read about in <em>Superman</em>). But at the same time Lex Luthor is also flying around Metropilis as Superman. Honestly, I’m sure that Dan Jurgens has great ideas when it comes to Superman comics and has written fantastic ones before. And I’m equally sure that the art team will produce some great work. But the whole idea seems far too confusing. I read a lot of comics and I’m pretty used to convoluted comic-book storylines and even I’m confused. Unless you have a masters in English literature, I would advise looking at something a little less confusing.</p>

<h2><strong>Trinity</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Writer: </em></strong>Francis Manupul<br />
<strong><em>Artist: </em></strong>Francis Manupul yet again<br />
<strong><em>Rebirth One Shot?: </em></strong>Not this time sports fans, <em>Trinity </em>is a new series.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Creative Team: </em></strong>This is an artist/writer solo team I feel like I can get behind. Francis Manupul began his career with Top Cow working on <em>Withcblade </em>and <em>Tomb Raider</em>. His work continued to be recognized with Manupul moving over to DC exclusively and eventually working on <em>The Flash</em> with Geoff Johns. After the New 52, Manupul stayed on the series, only now as both writer and artist. His run on the series was congratulated as being visually stunning and full of interesting ideas. The writing itself was still noted as being good, just not up to the same standard as the art. In addition to positive reviews around his art, Manupul has also won the Joe Shuster Award for Outstanding Art and the Inkwell All-In-One award for inking most of his own art. Manupul is no doubt a highly accomplished artist that I would predict will go on to be one of the best. It just remains to be seen if his writing can keep up.</p>

<p><strong><em>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </em></strong>In 2008 and 2009, there was a series surrounding the adventures of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman; it was called <em>Trinity</em>. This series is also called <em>Trinity</em> and, surprise, it’s about the same thing. Exploring the dynamic between DC’s 3 biggest characters and still telling a great story is no small task. I’m confident that the book will look good at the very least, but I remain to be convinced on the actual story itself and the skill of the writer behind it. Approach cautiously.</p>

<h2><strong>Wonder Woman (Twice Monthly)</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Writer: </em></strong>Greg Rucka<br />
<strong><em>Artist: </em></strong>Liam Sharp and Nicola Scott<br />
<strong><em>Rebirth One Shot?: </em></strong>Surely is, Greg Rucka is set to return to <em>Wonder Woman </em>and shake things up.</p>
<div id="attachment_38455" style="width: 559px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-38455" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wonder-woman-rebirth.jpg" alt="Wonder Woman Rebirth- On Sale June 8th" width="549" height="777" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wonder-woman-rebirth.jpg 549w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wonder-woman-rebirth-212x300.jpg 212w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wonder-woman-rebirth-298x422.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wonder Woman Rebirth- On Sale June 8th</p></div>
<p><strong><em>The Creative Team: </em></strong>First, let’s talk art.  The way this run of <em>Wonder Woman</em> will work is that each odd numbered issue will be done by Liam Sharp, and each even numbered issue will be done by Nicola Scott. Liam Sharp is a comic book art veteran, having made his start in 1980 on industry giant <em>2000AD. </em>His work as an artist was quickly recognized and he worked on a variety of titles before moving over to Marvel UK. Afterwards, the work kept coming with well-received runs on <em>X-Men</em>,<em> Spiderman </em>and<em> Hulk</em> for Marvel and <em>Superman </em>and <em>Batman </em>for DC. Sharp has illustrated well over 50 different mini-series and each time he is congratulated as a distinctive artist with real flair.</p>
<p>Nicola Scott hails from just across the ditch in Australia and, despite a shorter career compared to Sharp, still appears to be a great artist. Beginning in 2002, Scott quickly rose through the ranks, joining DC in 2004 and was called a ‘Talent to Watch’ by Wizard in 2005. She then began to work with Gail Simon on both <em>Birds of Prey</em> and <em>Secret Six,</em> where her art was commended both times. Scott appears to be an artist with great talent who, after working on a few smaller series, is more than ready to switch over to the big time (as it were).</p>
<p>Now, Greg Rucka. When Rucka was announced as the writer for the new <em>Wonder Woman</em>, fans were excited, and it seems for good reason. Rucka is a critically acclaimed and award winning writer with a solid history when it comes to Wonder Woman. Starting as an novel writer, Rucka entered the world of comics with <em>Whiteout </em>and it’s sequel <em>Whiteout: Melt</em>, the latter earning him an Eisner for Best Limited Series. Rucka went on to write a wide variety of series and mini-series, winning another 5 Eisner Awards and nominated for another 12. His best work with penning the character was in <em>Wonder Woman: The Hiketeia</em>. This limited series is praised as potentially the best Wonder Woman story ever written, and is given as a prime example of Wonder Woman characterization done not only right, but excellently. With a run on the main series also attracting high praise, it’s not hard to see why you might be excited about this version of <em>Wonder Woman</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>What Is It About, and Is It Worth It?: </em></strong>Yes, it’s worth it. Straight up. If you like Wonder Woman, superheroes, good writing, good art, strong female characters, or just good comics, then yes this is worth it. Rucka seems to be taking full advantage of the bi-monthly format with two stories being told simultaneously. Each odd numbered issue will be set ‘now’ and will deal with Wonder Woman’s quest to discover the truth around her past. Promises of monsters, magic and heroism abound, so expect good things here. Every even numbered issue will be around Wonder Woman&#8217;s first moments in the world of man, and will be Greg Rucka’s effort to redefine the Wonder Woman mythos for a new generation. 100% worth it. My expectations are enormously high.</p>
<p><strong><u>What I’ll Be Taking Away</u></strong></p>
<p>As much as I recognise the importance of Superman as a comic book and cultural icon, I’m just not that big a fan. I won’t be getting any of the Superman books. Not because they’re terrible or anything, I’m just not that interested. I will be picking up <em>New-Superman</em> as I have enjoyed all of Gene Luen Yang’s work that I have read, and <em>Wonder Woman</em> as I feel I’d be mad to miss it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gideon Blake is definitely not your stereotypical soldier – he has a kind heart, sensitive stomach, and a haunted past. He was training to be a U.S. Army Ranger and while he had the ambition and expertise for that calling, his military career was cut short when he was gravely injured in a parachuting accident. At that point destiny intervened in his life, and his story followed a series of unexpected turns.</p>
<p>The story begins with Gideon being interrogated by secretive government officials, which gives the reader a front seat to his adventure that is both supernatural and yet filled with human frailty. Then, we flashback to the past and learn that Gideon recovered much too quickly from his nearly fatal accident. He begins to suspect that something is amiss, especially when he takes a closer look at the seamless metal band on his wrist. It’s pretty clearly not military issue.</p>
<p>While visiting his sister at her college dorm, he goes to a party and meets a beautiful, confident woman named Daryn who tells him they need to leave right away or he’ll get hurt by the Kindred, the ancient evil who lurks throughout the story and occasionally kicks Gideon’s ass both mentally and physically. Gideon is both impressed and intimidated by Daryn.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-38267" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/23430471.jpg" alt="23430471" width="317" height="475" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/23430471.jpg 317w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/23430471-200x300.jpg 200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/23430471-298x447.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /></p>
<p>Having met Daryn, Gideon learns that he is now War, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, and he has a fiery, rampaging horse that scares him to death (both because it’s fierce and as we later learn, he has no idea how to ride a horse). The first part of Gideon and Daryn’s mission is to bring together the three other horsemen. Each of the horsemen have a power, a magical weapon, and a mystical horse. Since the horsemen have all these mystic weapons and ghostly horses, one might expect that they would easily win the day, but they’re a part of the regular old world which also requires money and tends to be easily spooked by mystical horses. Faced with reality’s constraints, the good guys must be creative in achieving their mission and keeping the Kindred from causing the apocalypse.</p>
<p>This novel weaves together the triumphs and failures of the characters into a compelling story that showcases the redemption of normal people who learn that they can accomplish something amazing and overcome most (but not all) of their flaws. The pace of the story feels unique and more interesting thanks to it being told by Gideon with a mixture of flashbacks and glimpses at his current plight. I greatly appreciated that the characters had troubled pasts as that made their struggle to overcome their own insecurities and battle evil feel more real. In a similar manner, the love story between Daryn and Gideon is better because of the tension and compromises that they make, rather than being an easy story tale romance. Also, I immediately liked Daryn’s character and was thrilled to be reading a novel that has both a sensitive male character and a dominant, awesome female.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a compelling novel where there are unexpected twists around every corner that keeps you reading, even if the dialogue feels a bit stilted at times. It’s well worth reading to encounter the surprising and realistic ending that is the perfect capstone to this unusual battle between good and evil.</p>

Being dead for a couple of days apparently deteriorates your leg muscles because Jon tries to get up off of the slab he&#8217;s been laying on and he stumbles but Davos is there to catch him and cloak him. Jon remembers being stabbed but there was nothing after he died. Melisandre admits that Stannis was not the Prince the was promised by the Red God but maybe Jon is? Jon laments about trying to do what he thought was right but failing and Davos tells him to go fail again. With the help of Davos, Jon walks out into the open, where he is greeted by Tormund. The gathered men think Jon is a God but Tormund knows Jon is not because he has seen Jon&#8217;s dick and no God would have a dick that small. Classic dick goof. Jon hugs Edd, who comments that Jon&#8217;s eyes are still brown, instead of the blue of the Others &#8211; Jon jokes about waiting on burning his body, which leads to Ed asking if Jon is actually Jon since he&#8217;s making funny jokes now. Such goofs.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Sam, Gilly, and bebe Sam are sailing to Oldtown, or so Gilly thinks. Sam is not doing well on this voyage &#8211; he looks pretty green. Gilly is pretty excited about seeing Oldtown but the Citadel doesn&#8217;t allow women or children and Sam won&#8217;t have the same pull at the Citadel as he did at Castle Black. He shoots down the idea of Gilly staying outside of the Citadel; he&#8217;s taking them to Hornhill instead. His dad is a dick but his mom and sisters are pretty nice so they will take care of Gilly and bebe Sam. Gilly is put off by this idea but Sam tries to get her to understand and she relents, saying she and Sam trust in him. Sidenote: what an emotional rollercoaster Sam is in for &#8211; getting a raven saying Jon is dead and then getting another saying &#8220;never mind, he&#8217;s alive. JK.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Bran and the Three Eyed Raven are watching two men sharpening their swords at the base of a tower, when more men coming riding up from a distance. When the men get to the tower, Bran recognizes one of the men that rode up as Ned. The Three Eyed Raven points out one of the other men with Ned as Howland Reed and Bran recognizes one the men guarding the tower as Arthur Dayne. Ned and Arthur exchange a few words about the Battle of the Trident &#8211; more importantly, why Arthur wasn&#8217;t at the Trident protecting Rhaegar. Arthur tells Ned that Rhaegar wanted them at the tower instead, which leads Ned to ask him the whereabouts of Lyanna. In response, Arthur prepares for the fight and wishes Ned good fortune in the wars to come &#8211; &#8220;And now it begins&#8221; to which Ned replies &#8220;no, now it ends&#8221; and a very well choreographed swordfight ensues. Bran realizes that Arthur is a better swordsman than Ned but knows that Ned beat Arthur from the stories he has heard over the years. But he finds out that Ned defeated Arthur because Howland stabbed Arthur in the back, which let Ned kill Arthur. There is a scream from the tower and Ned starts to rush up the stairs but the Three Eyed Raven tries to get Bran to leave. Bran wants to know what is in the tower so he shouts for his father, who stops and turns around, seemingly hearing something. But Bran is back in the cave and he is so mad &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t want to be in the cave and he doesn&#8217;t want to be a tree. The Three Eyed Raven tells him that he&#8217;s been waiting for a 1000 years for Bran so he can learn everything before Bran leaves the cave. No pressure.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The Dothraki have made it to Vaes Dothrak and Dany is taken to the Dosh Khaleen. (Can we pause a moment and admire the fine Dothraki dudes?) In the Dosh Khaleen, the women undress Dany and give her the clothes that they wear. Dany tries to protest saying she&#8217;ll have them punished, yadda yadda. The lady in charge knows who Dany is and that she was married to Khal Drogo, who was supposed to conquer the world with Dany by his side, but you know what? The lady was also married to a great Khal who was supposed to conquer the world with her by <em>his</em> side. Shit happens, you deal with it. Dany was supposed to come to the Dosh Khaleen as soon as Drogo died but she didn&#8217;t; she roamed around instead so she&#8217;s not going to be just let in. The Khalasars are meeting to decide on many things: what villages they raid, who they enslave, and now, they will also decide whether or not Dany will be let into the Dosh Khaleen. Good luck Dany!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Varys is in the throne room, waiting for the Unsullied to bring him Vala, the Meereenese prostitute who has been helping the Sons of the Harpy. Varys assures her that he will not torture her, since torture gets answers but often wrong ones. Vala obviously is not happy about the foreign invaders in her city but Varys says he understand her perspective. However, he also wants her to understand his perspective and then casually mentions her son, Dom. Of course, Varys doesn&#8217;t outright threaten Dom but gives her an option to give him information about the Sons of the Harpy and go on living with Dom: he has arranged for their passage on a ship to Pentos, along with a bag of silver.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-38440 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3-300x200.jpg" alt="3" width="801" height="534" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3-768x511.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3-1200x799.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3-298x198.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3-620x413.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tyrion is having a hard time having conversation with Greyworm and Missandei. Greyworm only talks about patrol and Missandei doesn&#8217;t seem to want to conversate or laugh at Tyrion&#8217;s jokes. They also don&#8217;t get the concept of games nor do they drink. Tyrion tries to get them to drink, to no avail, and then tries to get them to play a version of &#8220;truth or dare&#8221; without drinking but that doesn&#8217;t work either. Tyrion is rescued by Varys&#8217; entrance, who tells them that the Sons of the Harpy are being funded by the Good Masters of Astapor, the Wise Masters of Yunkai, and people in Volantis. NBD. Greyworm is more than ready to go over to those cities and conquer them once more but Tyrion reminds him that if the Unsullied leave for war, they will not be able to defend Meereen. Missandei reiterates that the Masters only know and recognize force and brutality. Tyrion is still iffy on using force just yet. First he wants messages sent to the Masters through Varys&#8217; birds.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-38432 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/got6.3qyburn-300x200.jpg" alt="got6.3qyburn" width="802" height="534" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/got6.3qyburn-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/got6.3qyburn-768x511.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/got6.3qyburn-298x198.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/got6.3qyburn-620x412.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/got6.3qyburn.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Speaking of birds, Varys&#8217; little birds in Kings Landing have a new friend in Qyburn, who sees their importance and use (I was actually pretty worried when I first saw him with the kids&#8230;whew!). He bribes them with candied plums and takes care of their injuries. The kids are scared when Cersei and Jaime walk into the room with FrankenGregor in tow. Qyburn doesn&#8217;t divulge how exactly he made FrankenGregor but he and Cersei admit that FrankenGregor won&#8217;t be able to defeat the hundreds of Faith&#8217;s Militant at the beck and call of the High Sparrow. FrankenGregor will eventually have to fight in a trial by combat as Cersei&#8217;s champion and when that happens, he will be fighting only one of the Faith&#8217;s Militant (Clegamebowl?). Cersei also wants little birds all over the Seven Kingdoms because she wants to know about anyone and everyone who is talking shit about her.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-38434 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jaime-cersei-smallcounciljpg-00b95ca2f0e0d42a-300x169.jpg" alt="jaime-cersei-smallcounciljpg-00b95ca2f0e0d42a" width="802" height="452" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jaime-cersei-smallcounciljpg-00b95ca2f0e0d42a-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jaime-cersei-smallcounciljpg-00b95ca2f0e0d42a.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jaime-cersei-smallcounciljpg-00b95ca2f0e0d42a-298x168.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the Small Council meeting, Maester Pycelle is talking mad shit about Qyburn and FrankenGregor, not knowing that Cersei, Jaime, and FrankenGregor have walked into the chamber. When he eventually sees them, he lets out a scared toot. Lolololol. Olenna is at the Small Council meeting to talk about the Queen&#8217;s imprisonment (Margaery) but Cersei mistakes them to have been talking about her ordeals. Olenna sets her straight alright. Kevan tries to tell them that they are not welcome at the Small Council meeting but Cersei and Jaime sit down anyway. Since they can&#8217;t make Cersei and Jaime leave, Kevan and the rest of the Small Council opt to leave instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-38441 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/High-Sparrow-Tommen-Game-of-Thrones-Season-6-300x150.jpg" alt="High-Sparrow-Tommen-Game-of-Thrones-Season-6" width="800" height="400" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/High-Sparrow-Tommen-Game-of-Thrones-Season-6-300x150.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/High-Sparrow-Tommen-Game-of-Thrones-Season-6-768x384.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/High-Sparrow-Tommen-Game-of-Thrones-Season-6-298x149.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/High-Sparrow-Tommen-Game-of-Thrones-Season-6-620x310.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/High-Sparrow-Tommen-Game-of-Thrones-Season-6.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Meanwhile, Tommen pays a visit to the High Sparrow, demanding that Cersei be allowed to visit Myrcella&#8217;s tomb but the High Sparrow tells him is impossible because she has not atoned for her sins. Tommen is visibly angry, chronicling all that Cersei suffered through but the High Sparrow tells him that she has to stand trial in front of 7 Septons. Tommen is still not happy about this situation so the High Sparrow basically tells him that Cersei has sinned and is a terrible person but she loves Tommen very much so her love for him makes him blind to her sins &#8211; sins that she still needs to atone. Man, Tommen you just got sweet talked, bruh.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-38430 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Game-of-Thrones-S06E03-Arya-1200x798-300x200.jpg" alt="Game-of-Thrones-S06E03-Arya-1200x798" width="803" height="535" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Game-of-Thrones-S06E03-Arya-1200x798-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Game-of-Thrones-S06E03-Arya-1200x798-768x511.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Game-of-Thrones-S06E03-Arya-1200x798.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Game-of-Thrones-S06E03-Arya-1200x798-298x198.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Game-of-Thrones-S06E03-Arya-1200x798-620x412.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Arya is still training to be the next Karate Kid *insert karate training montage music*. The Waif is still beating on her and asking her who she is &#8211; they&#8217;re doing the thing where Arya tells her about her life to see if the Waif can catch the little lies she tells, and if she does, Arya gets whacked. She had 4 brothers, 1 sister &#8211; 3 brothers, 1 sister, and a half brother. The Hound died because she left him to die &#8211; he was on her list &#8211; he was but then she took him off the list &#8211; she was confused. The people on her list were Cersei, Gregor Clegane, and Walder Frey. While they are fighting, the Waif turns around to hit Arya with her stick but Arya stops it with her stick &#8211; now she&#8217;s ready to take on the Cobra Kai. Jaqen offers to give her eyes back if she tells him her name but she says &#8220;a girl has no name&#8221;. He takes her by the pool of water in the House of Black and White and give her a cup of the water from the pool. She is afraid at first because she has seen people dying after drinking the water from the pool but Jaqen assures her that if she is truly no one, she has nothing to fear. Arya drinks from the cup and when she finishes, she has her sight back. He again asks her who she is and she again tells him that she is no one.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Smalljon Umber is at Winterfell, kind of pledging his allegiance to House Bolton because they will need help when the wildlings come south. He also knows very well that Ramsay killed Roose. He will not kneel before Ramsay nor kiss his ring but, in order to show that he can be trusted, he has brought Ramsay a small gift &#8211; in the form of Rickon Stark and Osha. When Ramsay questions the identity of Rickon, Smalljon shows him the severed head of Shaggyhead (or what I hope is a big wolf and not actually Shaggydog).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-38446 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SLJeeyHnRm8NA5kdPKJ7_Game_Of_Thrones_Ep_3_Header-300x113.jpg" alt="SLJeeyHnRm8NA5kdPKJ7_Game_Of_Thrones_Ep_3_Header" width="802" height="302" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SLJeeyHnRm8NA5kdPKJ7_Game_Of_Thrones_Ep_3_Header-300x113.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SLJeeyHnRm8NA5kdPKJ7_Game_Of_Thrones_Ep_3_Header-768x290.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SLJeeyHnRm8NA5kdPKJ7_Game_Of_Thrones_Ep_3_Header-298x113.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SLJeeyHnRm8NA5kdPKJ7_Game_Of_Thrones_Ep_3_Header-620x234.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SLJeeyHnRm8NA5kdPKJ7_Game_Of_Thrones_Ep_3_Header.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Back at the Wall, the men who stabbed Jon are at the gallows, waiting to be hanged to death. Jon walks up to them and asks them for their last words. Alliser says he tried to do the right thing and if he had to do it again, he would make the same choice &#8211; he seems to be okay with his fate. He is going to die but Jon died and got regenerated, so he will be fighting the battles for the wildings for a long time. Jon moves on to Olly, how has no last words but just an angry stare at Jon. Jon looks so sad and tired. He waits a while &#8211; I was afraid he wasn&#8217;t going to go through with the execution but he does. He cuts through the rope with Longclaw and the 4 men hang &#8211; we know they&#8217;re dead because we get a good closeup of their faces. After, he tells Edd to burn the bodies and gives the Lord Commander cloak to him, telling him to wear or burn it, Castle Black is Edd&#8217;s now. (But that&#8217;s not really how it works Jon &#8211; they have to elect the Lord Commander. YOU should know that, you JUST got elected not too long ago!) And then he walks off saying his walk has ended. Get it? Oathbreaker? Which, their watch ends at death and he already died, so technically his watch ended when he died. But technicalities.</p>

<p>The Indie presence was in full-force at PaxEast 2016 this year and with the Megabooth set in the dead center of the convention, it was an imposing figure on the show floor. I spent a great deal of time travelling through setups and have boiled down the Indie games that got my blood pumping.</p>

This one was on my anticipatory PAX game-list and, turns out, it was there for a very good reason. <em>Battle Chef Brigade</em> is, in the best summation I can muster, a cross between <em>Ironchef</em>/<em>Bubble-Bobble</em>/<em>Muramasa: The Demon Blade</em>. And it was fun as HECK. You take on the role of Mina, a young Chef preparing herself for her first foray into the culinary battlegrounds. Right away, I was awed by the hand-drawn animation and detailed character design of <em>BCB</em> and was what had interested me in the first place. Knowing the amount of dedication it takes to produce something so seamless as far as frames-per-second goes, they clearly put a lot of effort into achieving Ghibli-esque movement. I am self admittedly a <em>Match 3</em> addict and was very pleased when I discovered that the cooking elements of the game are essentially just that. Each ingredient that you use to prepare your dish is color-coded in a distinct way. When you add that element into a pot, it drops orbs into a match three game, so the only way to successfully create your dish is to be picky about your ingredients to ensure you can make your matches. Each successful match upgrades the orbs to ones that score more with the judges, so the key is to get as many as one color as possible and combining the upgraded orbs as they are created.</p>
<p>In the battle portion, you run out into the wild and hunt down monsters that will give you the ingredients you need to make your match, so it’s important to remember which monster gives you what. During the demo I hunted down a dragon and used its parts together to create a dish that gave me the edge over the computer opponent I was challenging, some kind of Dragon ramen.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I personally like my ramen like I like my dragons: muy caliente!</em></p>
<p>This game fulfilled so many elements of what I enjoy most about games: incredible design, collection mechanics, and sweet Candy Crush puzzles. I couldn’t be more excited about the official release of this game sometime in 2016, so expect a full-review once it’s available on Steam.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://burlymenatsea.com/">Burly Men At S</a><a href="http://burlymenatsea.com/">ea</a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-38385" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bmas.png" alt="bmas" width="995" height="622" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bmas.png 1000w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bmas-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bmas-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bmas-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bmas-620x388.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 995px) 100vw, 995px" /> The PAX convention floor is a cacophony of ambient sound, to the point where this media pass was ready to cocoon herself in a ball of introverted-induced coma and then I stepped into this game. It was quiet. It was simple, but simple in the way that really good gnocchi is: comforting and soul-nourishing. The art was boiled down into a lovely set of shapes and the three main characters essentially the same sprite save for the array of colored beards. I had found a restful mirage in amidst a sea of alluring, flashing lights.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>And that was just the line-up for Overwatch</em></p>
<p>Basically, <em>Burly Men at Sea</em> was more of a story then a game. The mechanics (from the demo that I played) involved dragging my cursor from side to side to reveal new parts of the play area I was in, which led to interaction with some sleepy townsfolk that tried (maybe not hard) to direct me to someone that may know about the map I found while fishing. ‘The Brothers Beard’, as they are affectionately known, are led in a direction which gets them Ahab-like eaten by a passing whale. From there they must negotiate with some round-talking naiads living in the whale’s mouth until they are forcefully ejected via blow-hole. Everything was just so&#8230; quiet, which was exactly what I needed.</p>
<p>Brain &amp; Brain gifts the player a minimalistic, alchemical tonic to a busy-mind &#8211; one this writer will use liberally to combat city-living.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/pyre/">Pyre</a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-38386" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pyre.jpg" alt="pyre" width="751" height="378" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pyre.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pyre-300x151.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pyre-298x150.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /><br />
SuperGiant’s newest release was probably my most surprising pick as a Con favorite, with the curious decision to make a sports game over their RPG standard. This immediately had me turning my nose towards the sky but I’ve trusted them enough with Bastion and Transistor, so I decided to make an appointment and give it a go. The reason it’s on this list is that it’s so much more than a sports game: lush graphic styles, mind melting sound design, and character development that gives <em>just</em> enough to leave me begging for the measly scraps they throw at my feet.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-38380 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/oliver-twist_3324271b-300x187.jpg" alt="oliver-twist_3324271b" width="728" height="454" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/oliver-twist_3324271b-300x187.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/oliver-twist_3324271b-298x186.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/oliver-twist_3324271b.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Please sir, I want some more.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It’s hard to describe exactly what is going on with the game narratively, but here is what the demo gives us: you’ve been thrown out of society, left for dead in the barren wastes of a cracked-earth desert and are found by a Caravan of other outcasts. Travelling with them, it’s discovered that you are able to read, a skill highly coveted by these wanderers because it means you can read the book of Rites. Participating in these rites is like a three-on-three game of basketball but, instead of shooting a sweet lay-up, you THROW YOURSELF INTO A FIRE. While this seems horrifying, the participants are salivating for it so I guess&#8230; all is well? The more bodies you burn, the higher your score, I failed my first attempt during the demo though so I have no idea what reward you get for trouncing the team you’re up against. I’d like to think my reward is an all-you-can-eat sushi dinner, but the more likely scenario is pieces to the puzzle that is you and your travelling companions&#8217; lives and the meaning of the Rites themselves.</p>
<p>I will readily admit that the sound design is a huge reason I liked this game as much as I did, even with the teams of Con-goers creating a din in the background. The score to <em>Transistor</em> is my go-to soundtrack for creative writing (given weight by the fact I have it on as I pen this), so the fact that Darren Korb took this project on as well made it a winner from the starting gate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we’re going to have to wait for my information on the game in the upcoming year as its release isn’t set until 2017. Until then, excuse me while I sigh dreamily at their concept.</p>
<hr />
<p>I didn’t get to play some of the games I was really looking forward to because the lines they created were just too long. Luckily, E3 is just around the corner, so expect to see the demos and sneak-peeks spring up like so many tulips are in the barren north!</p>
<p>Until the next new game, Carly out!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Living Campaign is a series of articles where every author has an impact on the world. Articles can focus on any part of the setting, from locations to NPCs or even events. Writers can add new elements to the world or they can build upon what already has been defined. This will be a system-agnostic series, meaning that it will provide flavor and content instead of stat blocks and monster entries.</p>
<p>The intent of this series is to provide inspiration for home games. It will draw on foundational elements from Lovecraftian fiction as well as the horror and urban fantasy genres. The ideas presented can be utilized individually, or as a whole. As the setting develops and evolves, special articles will feature story lines within the established world. But all of the content in this series is simply fodder for additional development.</p>
<p>The specific boundaries and details of this campaign setting are intentionally vague. This is done so that all contributors have absolute freedom to create whatever they wish. Authors can add in any geographic details they want, from coastlines to mountains. The city itself might contain a university, manufacturing plants, shipping docks, or any number of physical locations. The general location and time frame will be the United States in the 1920s. However, the nature of this genre lends itself to a certain flexibility. Anything can, and might, happen.</p>
<p>And with the introduction complete…welcome to New Coventry.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Salt Lick Farm : Location</span></p>
<p>Outside of town a few miles is an old, abandoned farm. The forest has reclaimed the previously plowed land. The buildings are all but destroyed, having been ravaged by wind and weather. This place has been abandoned so long that no-one in New Coventry even remembers who used to own the place. The one thing that stands out, though, is the fact that animals of all kinds congregate in the area.</p>
<p>Some of New Coventry&#8217;s old timers used to say that the animals were attracted to minerals in the land or left over in the abandoned buildings, and coined the name that everyone knows now. But if that was the case, the animals would&#8217;ve consumed the source of interest and wandered away. However, animals continue to congregate on the farm land. Some brave souls have tried to claim the land and establish a new farm. However, their effort always end in failure after a few months. Some share stories of poisoned earth in which nothing will grow. Others say that there is a deep underground spring that floods the land and kills any crops. And a few tell stories of odd occurrences that simply drove them away.</p>
<p>Over time, the farm has become the source of local tall tales. Young children dare each other to run through the fields and touch the decaying remains of the barn door. Teenagers attempt to spend the night to prove their bravery. Ghost stories are told about what really happened on the old farm, and about all the bodies buried in the back acres. Some people say they hear strange noises or see lights floating through the underbrush. But with all the woodland creatures that make the old farm land home, most everything can be explained. And occasionally, hobos squat in the ruined buildings. They are typically rousted after a local constable heads up to look for one of the town&#8217;s work horses that has wandered off.</p>
<p>Still, no amount of logic can change the fact that Salk Lick Farm is a creepy place.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blindspot &#8211; Swift Hardhearted Stone<img class="size-medium wp-image-38361 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hqdefault-300x225.jpg" alt="hqdefault" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hqdefault-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hqdefault-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hqdefault.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span></strong><br />
After two episodes of questionable quality, <em>Blindspot</em> returns to its established formula this week. And I think for the first time ever, Jane wounded a suspect instead of murdering him. Unfortunately, the show is a little rusty and it leaned heavily on some of the more annoying tropes of a procedural cop drama, like repetitive obvious statements or the skilled agents leaving the people they&#8217;re supposed to protect alone in the middle of the woods. I did enjoy Patterson taking charge and channeling her inner McCallister. Was blowing up the house the most logical or tactically appropriate solution? No. But it was entertaining. As is usual for <em>Blindspot</em>, the tattoo-related discovery was all about revealing corruption in the government. And there were the now-typical elements of drama and strife within the FBI team. By this point in the show, I don&#8217;t know if I want the face behind the voice modulator to be some new big bad guy or someone that has been part of this mystery all along. There are certainly elements in most of the main characters&#8217; story that could be twisted around in a &#8220;ha ha, it&#8217;s been me the whole time&#8221; moment. But I don&#8217;t think that <em>Blindspot</em> will pull this trick on viewers. It&#8217;s more likely to reveal a group of people that consider themselves above the law working on some grand scheme. What was that program that kept getting mentioned before Mister Nasty CIA Jerk got killed? I ask, because it hasn&#8217;t been mentioned or brought up since then. (Hint, it was Daylight.) Really, I just want the show to give its audience some straight answers instead of continuing the trend of confusing scenes and partial facts.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-38362 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gotham-azrael-movie-trailer-300x158.jpg" alt="gotham-azrael-movie-trailer" width="300" height="158" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gotham-azrael-movie-trailer-300x158.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gotham-azrael-movie-trailer-768x403.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gotham-azrael-movie-trailer.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gotham-azrael-movie-trailer-298x156.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gotham-azrael-movie-trailer-620x326.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Gotham &#8211; Azrael</span></strong><br />
It pains me greatly to see one of my favorite characters suffer the <em>Gotham</em> treatment. It is equally painful that the show changed its subtitle yet again. This perfectly demonstrates the fact that <em>Gotham</em> has no idea what it&#8217;s doing and is just wandering from one random idea to another. However, Azrael&#8217;s costume is pretty cool. It even has the pointless pouches like the 90s version in the comics. Although the completely bullet proof armor is stupidly impossible and reinforces the cartoon nature of the show. Using Azrael as Bruce&#8217;s inspiration is stupid. Even more stupid, though, is the implication that Strange is single-handedly responsible for the origins of the classic <em>Batman</em> villains. That being said, I&#8217;m starting to enjoy Wong&#8217;s portrayal of Professor Chinstrap. It&#8217;s horribly over-exaggerated and ridiculous, but it works. I may be wrong, but I think Wong is the only actor to embrace the insanity that is <em>Gotham</em> instead of pretending that it&#8217;s a serious show. I feel weird saying this, but I liked this episode of <em>Gotham</em>. I still don&#8217;t like Arkham being identified with pajamas and bad wigs, but I liked Nygma running the room and discovering the secret lab. I don&#8217;t like Galavan as a masked crazy (he was a solid political enemy before the stupid grudge and Saint Dumas elements were introduced) but the struggle between his personas is intriguing. I don&#8217;t like Penguin at all, but watching him go mad is entertaining. I still think that <em>Gotham</em> is utter nonsense and one of (if not the) worse shows on television, but this episode was pretty good. And actually, it disappointed me. When Gordon said the line about a bigger gun, I fully expected him to show up with a rocket launcher.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supernatural &#8211; Don&#8217;t Call me Shurley<img class="size-medium wp-image-38363 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/974691f3325e4565c59791051a4b81d6-300x169.jpg" alt="974691f3325e4565c59791051a4b81d6" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/974691f3325e4565c59791051a4b81d6-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/974691f3325e4565c59791051a4b81d6.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/974691f3325e4565c59791051a4b81d6-298x168.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span></strong><br />
Wow. I never expected this. Not only did this episode confirm a long-running fan theory, but it finally introduced the character that&#8217;s been missing from the show for years. When it first started, I expected this to be a trick or joke. But it&#8217;s legit. This was easily the best episode of <em>Supernatural</em> this entire season, if not in years. This episode just destroyed me. After those closing credits, I felt like I did way back when <em>Supernatural</em> first started and everything was new and surprising. This episode was all about the main plot of Amara, but it was from a completely different and long-overdue point of view. Dean and Sam were the B team. Their story and actions didn&#8217;t impact the main action. At first, I thought it was a lazy move to have the boys face the same infection from the start of the season. But when everything came together in the end, I realized that it was a good move. I appreciated seeing them completely overwhelmed with no chance of survival. And the ultimate point of this episode had nothing to do with the Winchesters. It&#8217;s been shown that they have absolutely no way to stop, impact, or effect what&#8217;s happening. This episode was about getting through to the only being that could do something about Amara. What I like best about this is that the Winchesters had nothing to do with it either. They didn&#8217;t know what was happening. This was a literal deus ex machina and it&#8217;s about time that it happened in <em>Supernatural</em>. I enjoy the plot of the Winchesters getting lucky, figuring out the solution and just barely surviving every time. But it&#8217;s an old and tired trope. With Supernatural running as long as it has, the constant repetition of this plot is boring. And while what happened this week is not quite a &#8220;game changer&#8221;, it has opened up the show to a new potential direction. I loved this episode. I hope that the awesome momentum is utilized correctly.</p>

After a season-long tease about the grand plan of a magic madman, the reveal of what&#8217;s happening is somewhat underwhelming. I really expected something bigger. Or at least, something different than every other villain&#8217;s plan in this universe. That being said, I do appreciate a relatively simple plan. I&#8217;m sure there will be some sort of unexpected twist in the last few episodes, but for now, at least, it&#8217;s nice to finally have some understanding of what&#8217;s been happening this season. Most of this episode was focused on Diggle and his family drama. The end result was unfortunate, but predictable. But since Andy has been portrayed as a villain since his introduction, this did not carry the weight of other similar events. Oliver learning about magic is long overdue. The nod to Hub City is nice, as is the continued reference to Constantine. Maybe he&#8217;ll return one glorious day. I don&#8217;t like the team being split up. They are already down by one. I like the good guys being faced with a challenge, but they&#8217;ve been in that position all season. As the finale nears, I would like to see the good guys with more in their corner than &#8220;Oliver can make his eyes yellow&#8221;. But <em>Arrow</em> is always about overcoming obstacles, so I am sure that something dramatic will happen in the last few episodes. The one thing that I want to see more of in Arrow is more heroes. The show works well with a big supporting cast. And it has successfully featured other heroes before. I&#8217;d like to see Oliver as the driving force behind assembling a team&#8230;maybe a league, if you will.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Flash &#8211; Rupture<img class="size-medium wp-image-38365 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Flash-Episode-2.20-Rupture-300x200.jpg" alt="The Flash - Episode 2.20 - Rupture" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Flash-Episode-2.20-Rupture-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Flash-Episode-2.20-Rupture-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Flash-Episode-2.20-Rupture-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Flash-Episode-2.20-Rupture.jpg 726w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span></strong><br />
Oh, that&#8217;s a clever way to keep the Flash in the picture until the Speedforce issue is resolved. Nice. I&#8217;m honestly surprised by the tone of this episode. Zoom&#8217;s attack towards the end was brutal and very contradictory to the overall tone of <em>Flash</em>. It&#8217;s not out of character for Zoom, given the origin that was revealed, but it just doesn&#8217;t fit the show. Cisco&#8217;s plot felt a little heavy-handed and out of place. It wasn&#8217;t badly done, but as this is the fourth to last episode this season, I think the screen time could&#8217;ve been used better. The biggest part of this episode was all about Barry making the decision to be the Flash. Which has happened before. So I&#8217;m not really sure why they wasted so much time on it this time around. No, I guess I do. It was to build up the suspense for what happened at the end. As surprising as it was, it was completely predictable because it&#8217;s happened in every Flash comic ever. I&#8217;ll say right now that Barry has been either blasted into the Speedforce itself or has gotten knocked to some other part of the multiverse. Obviously he got his speed back and just needs to run home. Of course, to a viewer that&#8217;s not familiar with the comics, this was a big freaking deal and probably very shocking. So in that mindset, this was a huge surprise. Personally, I&#8217;m more excited by what happened to Wally and Jesse. If this doesn&#8217;t finally get them to be speedsters, I don&#8217;t know what will. My hope is that the finale of this season will be Zoom versus a team of speedsters. If Barry isn&#8217;t fast enough, he needs help, right? Or maybe he&#8217;ll just get super fast from being disintegrated. Because comic books, right?</p>

After last week&#8217;s sub-par episode, this one delivered the good stuff. This is the Savage that I&#8217;ve been wanting to see ever since <em>Legends</em> premiered. He is at his best as a manipulator. Which is why the fight scene at the end was not very entertaining to me. I don&#8217;t want to see Savage win in a brawl. I want to see him out-think everyone in the room and defeat them before they even act. Thus, the throw-away exposition about him jumping through time feels cheap. Let Savage be so smart that he avoided capture, not just wave it away because he figured out time travel. I love that, as usual, the criminals and the assassin are the smartest people in the room. I also love that this episode continues to point out that Rip is not only bad at his job (he literally said that he didn&#8217;t know how to pilot his own ship) and fantastical to the point of killing his team, but that his own actions spurred the tragedy that he uses to justify his crusade. If <em>Legends</em> had been more about the philosophical debate over Rip&#8217;s fanaticism and whether or not Savage was actually a villain, it would&#8217;ve been a perfect show. Carter&#8217;s return was, in my mind, pointless. The drama of his &#8220;brainwashing&#8221; was ended in less than a single episode. And ultimately, wouldn&#8217;t killing him effectively be a reset button? What did Savage actually do? It&#8217;s been established that the Hawks forget everything any time they die. So all Savage did was find Carter and recruit him. There wasn&#8217;t really any &#8220;brainwashing&#8221;. I think Carter as a villain in a few episode arc would&#8217;ve been interesting. I did like the ending, simply because it proved that Savage is the character I want him to be. I also enjoyed the flashbacks, even if they did disrupt the momentum of the episode. Getting rid of Jax will certain have some sort of nasty side effect. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprise if he shows up as a villain with a story about being lost in time. But he&#8217;ll probably switch back right away.</p>

<p>Oh HBO, you are such a tease! This week, got mere feet away from the biggest mystery in all of Game of Thrones, only to be whisked away by Bran&#8217;s tree daddy. That being said, we still had some fun moments this week. We got to see groggy Jon Snow take vegence on those that wronged him, Dany kept up her streak of not much going on, and we got to see what Sam and Gilly were up to. Spoiler, vomiting into buckets. Also what is any episode 3 without a good old blind fighting montage.</p>
<p>If it wasn&#8217;t for Rickon&#8217;s scene this would&#8217;ve been a great episode, RIP lil pup.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not a light book. Ada Palmer has rewritten the whole history of the modern world and the onrushing future, according to philosophies both new and old, but deeply held and profoundly discussed regardless of their age. Questions of progress, of perfection, of right living. It&#8217;s heavy and at times perplexing. But all of that is to the good, since it&#8217;s also not a book that should be taken lightly.</p>
<p>But the plot? Oh, yes, the plot. Our narrator, Mycroft Canner, is a criminal and a genius, though not&#8211;probably&#8211;a criminal genius. Especially not since he got caught, and is living out the rest of his life as a Servicer, one who can have no possessions or place, but can use his talents to better society and earn back some measure of self-sufficiency and honor thereby. Some Servicers work cleaning mucky streets, but Mycroft is called upon by the most elite of the elite, presidents and emperors, to do less menial work. He assists in determining economic futures for the world economy; he aids in investigations of the most celebrated inventor of the age; he serves the clandestine needs of a scandal-ripe, doubly-royal family.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-38286" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/too-like-Cover.jpg" alt="too-like-Cover" width="409" height="622" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/too-like-Cover.jpg 741w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/too-like-Cover-197x300.jpg 197w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/too-like-Cover-298x453.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/too-like-Cover-620x942.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></p>
<p>Seeing all this through his calculating eyes would be enough, but Mycroft&#8217;s true fealty lies not with any of these. It belongs to a boy named Bridger, eight years old, who can bring his imaginings to life. In an age brightened by science, there is a child who could singlehandedly bring back religion. Religion&#8211;that is, the collective adherence to dogmatic truths&#8211;is banned for fear of the conflicts it inspires. But individual faith and questioning is still allowed, and sensayers are the guardians of that line between faith and religion. They act as confessors, educators, and skeptics all in one, encouraging people to ponder the big questions but disallowing the imposition of any conclusions.</p>
<p>What could a miracle child do to such a fine but well-tended line?</p>
<p>I did find myself somewhat exhausted by the experience of reading this book, since really, for any other author, this would be two books, or three, or more. The political maneuverings in a highly politically charged world are enough for a book. But these  politics take place in spheres and terms that do not (yet) exist. Add to it the presence of Bridger, miraculous child in a world duly afraid of religion and therefore of miracles, and you have a truly dizzying array of stories competing for your attention. I do think Palmer could have done a better job introducing these people and factions, since often she drops names and lets the context for them come later. Now, I&#8217;m all for immersive writing, but this is a fictional history. We lack the context for even the basics we now take for granted&#8211;gender presentation, transportation, family dynamics&#8211;so adding another layer of complexity leaves the reader gasping. Plus,the narrator is not shy about interjecting opinions and explanations&#8211;so why not more of them, and sooner?</p>
<p>I was tempted occasionally to break out a notebook to keep everything straight, but in the end it wasn&#8217;t necessary. Why? Because Palmer&#8217;s characterization skills are so top-notch. You may have to skim backward to remind yourself of the finer points of faction politics, but once a character is introduced, they aren&#8217;t easily confused with anyone else. There&#8217;s no mistaking the alluring Danae with the mothering Bryar, nor any confusion of Ojiro the spectacle-prone <em>androgyne</em> with the deadly Dominic, who also uses gender as a means and not an end.</p>
<p>Yes, gender in this world has become more enlightened as well. I prefer Ann Leckie&#8217;s simpler system in which gender is called into question simply by referring to everyone as &#8220;she,&#8221; regardless of biology. It&#8217;s an elegant way to destabilize the concept. Palmer likewise de-normalizes gender by using the increasingly popular &#8220;they&#8221; and &#8220;them,&#8221; a move that probably has a greater likelihood of catching on and certainly does sidestep the gender binary. But then Palmer adds &#8220;he&#8221; and &#8220;she&#8221; back in according to different standards, not just going by whether characters choose a certain gender presentation, but also according to 18th century standards of what was coded masculine or feminine.</p>
<p>If gender truly doesn&#8217;t matter, then neither should this. Yes, all right, that&#8217;s fair. I&#8217;m not objecting on a philosophical principle, and I think this actually does advance the idea of expanding/eliminating gender in some ways. But it&#8217;s <em>confusing</em>. Confusing to have so many competing standards, confusing to have the narrator at odds with the dialogue he is purporting to write. Mycroft tells us that Dominic is biologically female but has adopted the dress of an 18th century man, and so will be referred to as a man, except when other characters refer to Dominic as &#8220;they.&#8221; It&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s impossible to follow on its own, it&#8217;s just that there is yet again one more layer to all of this, and not very much time to catch up.</p>
<p>Do these complaints render the book less worthy? No. In fact, there are more good ideas here than I&#8217;ve seen in the past dozen science fiction novels combined (with the exception of Ms. Leckie&#8217;s work, natch). Political buffs, religious inquirers, and anyone who thinks about the fate of the future ought to read this. This book is the perfect, <em>perfect </em>antidote to the rash of dystopian fiction (and dystopian realities&#8211;looking at you, Trump supporters) flooding our shelves recently. It describes a future full of hope and progress, not perfect, but with perfection as a goal. Not security, not survival, but perfection. I can&#8217;t fully explain what a joy and <em>relief </em>it is to be in that world, no matter how hard I had to work to keep up with it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few elements to a video game that will ensure I will want to play it. One is if I can date in the game; preferably date humans, but I have settled for pigeons before. The second is if it has any dealings with a period of history that I find interesting, I will want to give it a go. The third, and probably the most compelling for me, is if it is a horror game. I cannot get enough of being scared and when movies fail me, I find that horror video games are quickly becoming my go to in getting that adrenaline rush. Enter <em>Outlast</em>. A few years ago, I watched a video of a group of friends playing a game in which the player went to an asylum and ran away from grotesque monsters, deformed figures, and other horrific elements. The point of the game wasn’t a matter of finishing the mission before your character died, it was simply trying to last as long as you could and survive. I was hooked and I scrambled to download the game as soon as I could, waiting to run around and scream like a fool in my living room. </span></p>

<p>This PAX East, as I walked around the booths, I found myself standing in front of a black hut that had logs protruding from the front and line wrapped around the back. I looked to the side and saw <em>Outlast II</em> and nearly fainted from joy mixed with anxiety of what was going on inside the hut. The next day, Nick Bristow and I made our way to Red Barrels’s booth and entered the hut through curtains which cut the light from the convention hall and dampened the roar of the crowd to almost a hum. I should note: before we entered the booth, there were disclaimers that our game-play experience could be recorded and used for future purposes and I have to tell you, my anxiety level and joy heightened immediately &#8211; I knew that Red Barrels was serious about the game they made and that this was going to be the horror game I craved. Nick and I were led into a private booth, with the only light coming from the darkened screen, just enough to find the controller and headphones. After getting situated and wiping the sweat from my hands, I prepared myself as best I could for the game demo.</p>
<div id="attachment_38137" style="width: 1353px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38137 " src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast-2-Shot-03.jpg" alt="Outlast-2-Shot-03" width="1343" height="755" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast-2-Shot-03.jpg 1920w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast-2-Shot-03-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast-2-Shot-03-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast-2-Shot-03-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast-2-Shot-03-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast-2-Shot-03-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1343px) 100vw, 1343px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Definitely nothing wrong that can happen here&#8230;.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Outlast II</em> opens with a husband and wife journalist team, on their way to investigate the murder of a pregnant woman. There is trouble though and through the cut-scene you experience a crash, separating you from your wife and gear. Stumbling down the cavern, it appears that your character is in the American Southwest, on the outskirts of an abandoned town. Armed with only your camcorder and limited battery life, Blake (the player character) must make his way through the town, try to find his way back to civilization, and to find his wife. Walking through the town, everything is falling down and in a complete state of disarray. Bloodstains spatter the walls of homes and dead livestock fill barns, leaving the buzzing sound of flies in the player’s ears. Behind every turn is a new horror to stumble upon and eventually the player finds themselves being chased and hunted down. The demo played until after I died, which was enough time for me to let out a scream and basically jump into Nick out of fear. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_38135" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38135 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast2-Window-1920x1080.jpg" alt="Outlast2-Window-1920x1080" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast2-Window-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast2-Window-1920x1080-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast2-Window-1920x1080-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast2-Window-1920x1080-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast2-Window-1920x1080-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Outlast2-Window-1920x1080-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Oops&#8230;wrong address. I&#8217;ll just be seeing myself out.&#8221;</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just from playing the demo, I was blown away. It was everything I wanted in a second installment in the series and in a horror game in general. The controls were effortless, allowing the player to become fully immersed in the game and truly feel the fear that Blake is experiencing. The story still holds true to the original Outlast mechanics and what people will expect from the game, but encapsulates an almost cult/demonic story-line, providing the player with a different playing experience. <em>Outlast II</em> is currently still in development, but will be available for PC, PS4, and Xbox One. Until the game is released watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhiP5FBcCXc?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" target="_blank">teaser trailer</a> and try to get some sleep tonight. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PAX East brings the big name for games to showcase the recently released, upcoming, and works in development. But my favorite parts of PAX are the wonderful Indie games that are out there and available to play, like the one that I found from Authentic Illusions, Arbor Sheep, and Games Starter: <em>Realm Walk of Soul</em>. <em>Realm</em> follows the story of Iris who finds herself in a waking nightmare.  In a world that is full of the creepy dolls, scary landscapes, and ominous omens abound, Iris (and the player), must work her way through various challenging puzzles in order to find her way back to “normal” life and reality. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-38127" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/realm-walk-of-soul-ps-vita-ps4-20160206-012.jpg" alt="realm-walk-of-soul-ps-vita-ps4-20160206-012" width="962" height="543" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/realm-walk-of-soul-ps-vita-ps4-20160206-012.jpg 960w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/realm-walk-of-soul-ps-vita-ps4-20160206-012-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/realm-walk-of-soul-ps-vita-ps4-20160206-012-768x434.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/realm-walk-of-soul-ps-vita-ps4-20160206-012-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/realm-walk-of-soul-ps-vita-ps4-20160206-012-620x350.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 962px) 100vw, 962px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visually, the game reminded me of a Japanese horror film, mixed with reminiscences of <em>Resident Evil</em> monsters and a haunting soundtrack, like that in <em>Silent Hill,</em> that gave me chills. All of these elements come together in a game that, with very little dialogue, tells a clear and concise story that isn’t overburdened by cut-scenes and allows the player to become completely enveloped in the story. The game-play is fairly easy to pick up and has very few requirements in terms of controls, making the game easy to pick up for people who are not used to playing games. The difficulty of the game comes with the various types of puzzles that are in place to allow Iris to move through the world. Now full disclosure here: I am not good at puzzles and I typically will give up after a few tries if I can’t get the puzzle figured out. But <em>Realm</em> kept me entertained with the puzzles and, while the puzzles were challenging, they were not impossible. That was the beauty of <em>Realm</em> to me while I was playing it. The game does not present you with an impossible task or mission. All the puzzles that are in the game can be figured out with some thought and effort. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-38128" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5885803.jpg" alt="5885803" width="818" height="460" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5885803.jpg 695w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5885803-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5885803-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5885803-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 818px) 100vw, 818px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, I very much enjoyed my time playing <em>Realm Walk of Soul</em> for the whole experience it provided me, the player. The horror aspect of this game is very present and had me shrieking and chiding away from certain places because of what was lurking in the shadows. The puzzles were difficult and provided a challenge to the player, but did not detract from the overall atmosphere of the game. Lastly, the art, story, and sound together, presents to the player a game that is visually appealing and really aids in telling the story without heavy and obtrusive dialogue. The game trailer is available to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7qWd-Krl6s" target="_blank">here</a>, but<em> Realm Walk of Soul</em> is available now on Steam for PC and Mac, PS4, and PSVita. </span></p>

<p>I was lucky enough to start my PAX East experience with a play through of <em>Widow&#8217;s Walk</em>, the new expansion for <em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em>. For those not familiar with the classic semi-cooperative horror game, let me give you a quick explanation of how it works. The first half of the game is cooperative as your group explores the spooky House of the Hill by laying down random room tiles. The original game had a 1st floor, 2nd floor, and basement for you to explore. Each new room might have an event, allow you to pick up an item, or trigger an omen. Once you have enough omens, you trigger a haunt, which completely changes the game.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-38334" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Betrayal-at-House-on-the-Hill-Widows-Walk-Box-Art-1.jpg" alt="Betrayal-at-House-on-the-Hill-Widow's-Walk----Box-Art-1" width="500" height="410" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Betrayal-at-House-on-the-Hill-Widows-Walk-Box-Art-1.jpg 500w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Betrayal-at-House-on-the-Hill-Widows-Walk-Box-Art-1-300x246.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Betrayal-at-House-on-the-Hill-Widows-Walk-Box-Art-1-298x244.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />Haunts are all unique, and most of them turn one of the players into a betrayer. It is then a scramble to complete some set of usually adversarial goals, like being murdered vs. not being murdered. There are a enough unique haunts that the game feels like you are in a unique story each time you play it.</p>
<p><em>Widow&#8217;s Walk</em> expands on the core game by adding 50 new haunts, and the roof, which is an entire new floor to explore. There are also 20 new room tiles, 30 new cards and a mess of tokens that allow you to track your explorer&#8217;s progress.</p>
<p>Mike Selinker, the original designer of <em>Betrayal</em>, and lead on <em>Widow&#8217;s Walk</em> joined us for our game, and gave us some insight on the expansion. The new haunts were written by an all-star cast of contributors from the gaming and general nerd world. You can find the <a href="http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill/widows-walk">complete list here</a>. With many authors come many different perspectives, which should mean that each play through of the expansion should feel even more unique.</p>
<p>Selinker also worked to make getting around the house easier. I won&#8217;t spoil the surprise, but there are new rooms that will make going between floors, and jumping between spots in the map easier. Adding new tiles also gave him the opportunity to add in the room most requested by fans: a bathroom.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a fan of <em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em>, and look forward to exploring a bigger house when <em>Widow&#8217;s Walk</em> is released on October 14. The expansion won&#8217;t dramatically change gameplay and really boils down to just &#8220;more <em>Betrayal&#8221;</em>, but additional options for getting around the board and buckets of new content make it a very attractive expansion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I first encountered Paul Kearney in the most tragic way possible: I began his Sea Beggars trilogy. Oh, the trilogy itself isn&#8217;t any more tragic than any other quality fantasy novel. The tragedy is that, because of some shadowy dispute with the publisher, the third book doesn&#8217;t exist. It will probably never come out. It&#8217;s a friggin&#8217; travesty! I&#8217;m still upset about it more than ten years later.</p>
<p>Fortunately, (a) this tragedy hasn&#8217;t stalled Kearney&#8217;s other writing and (b) this book is complete unto itself. Crisis averted.</p>
<p>This story, <em>Wolf in the Attic</em>, contains (as the book jacket promises) mention of the two most famous Inklings, and hints of their magical realms. And it does feature werewolves and other fell beasties that Tolkien and Lewis would be pleased to describe. But the world it&#8217;s in is in fact quite terrifyingly real, both for its setting (1920s England) and for the way that setting echoes into today: both are contending with a huge and tragic refugee crisis. In both times, Greece is a focal point, a place where ancient stories abut new dramas full of pain and sadness. Anna and her father have escaped Greece, which lies in burning ruins, but as refugees in Oxford they face new threats of poverty and xenophobia. (Strange, to use the Greek word to express fear of the Greeks, who once held the whole world as foreign and themselves at the center of it&#8230;)</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-38233" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/the-wolf-in-the-attic-9781781083628_hr-777x1200.jpg" alt="the-wolf-in-the-attic-9781781083628_hr" width="444" height="686" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/the-wolf-in-the-attic-9781781083628_hr-777x1200.jpg 777w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/the-wolf-in-the-attic-9781781083628_hr-194x300.jpg 194w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/the-wolf-in-the-attic-9781781083628_hr-768x1187.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/the-wolf-in-the-attic-9781781083628_hr-298x460.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/the-wolf-in-the-attic-9781781083628_hr-620x958.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/the-wolf-in-the-attic-9781781083628_hr.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /></p>
<p>Anna is keen to explore this world, and chafes at the boundaries her age and gender and heritage place on her. Her tutor wants her to be a lady; her father wants her to forget Greece and the family they left behind there; her exile community is more interested in getting drunk and reminiscing than moving forward. So she sneaks out at night to play at being an explorer, and to satisfy her innate wildness. What she finds on the streets of Oxford and the wilds outside it is more wild than any story her father or the nice Professor Lewis can tell.</p>
<p>There are wolves and ancient creatures in the woods. There are pale men who can steal the warmth from fire, and dark silhouettes that loom in the barrows, shadow like men but with great racks of horns. Anna finds these, and plenty of tragedy in their wake. Fortunately, she also has the grit to see her story through.</p>
<p>It reminds me a bit of <em>Davida&#8217;s Harp</em>, a lesser-known work from Chaim Potok written from the perspective of a young girl. There&#8217;s that same attention to the particularities of youth and girlhood, the simultaneous blitheness and sharp eye for injustice. The world is very different to girls like Davida and Anna, who are smart but not yet wise, unaccustomed to the cruelty and capriciousness of life, and therefore sometimes more able to defy it. Anna strikes out on her own in more ways than one, wandering Oxford and the wilds outside it, but also exploring the dark recesses of her own home, the attic and the secrets of her family.</p>
<p>There were times while reading that I almost had to put the book down, kick up my legs into the air, and flail and squeal like a tween getting a call from her first crush. (A text? A snapchat? What do the youths do these days? Whatever.) It&#8217;s that good. It just makes you want to clutch it to your chest and go <em>where have you been, you gorgeous book?</em></p>
<p>I was entirely enchanted until perhaps the last twenty pages, when things began to slip a little. It wasn&#8217;t a bad ending, and it didn&#8217;t feel wrong for the story. It just seemed a little bit convenient, in the way that the end of <em>The Stand</em> felt both appropriate and also like someone who had written himself into a corner and had to make a happy ending from the cobwebs that had tangled there: a bit <em>thin</em>, ultimately, a bit insubstantial. Does this negate what came before? Absolutely not. Is this book still worth picking up? Yes, worth buying and owning, at that. But I will be puzzling over this ending for a while, pleased though I am to have gotten any ending from Kearney at last.</p>
<p><em>Wolf in the Attic </em>will be released tomorrow, May 10.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim and I had the chance to try out <a href="http://www.momentumvolsk.com/">Momentum Volsk&#8217;s</a> <em>Castle Assault</em> at PAX East 2016 and decided to commemorate the occasion by doing our very first conversation style article! Maybe we can make this more of a thing in the future?? Gotta use our ridiculous Gchat conversations somehow!</span></p>
<p><a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Castle-Assault-1.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-38295" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Castle-Assault-1-927x1200.jpg" alt="Castle Assault" width="402" height="521" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Castle-Assault-1-927x1200.jpg 927w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Castle-Assault-1-232x300.jpg 232w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Castle-Assault-1-768x994.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Castle-Assault-1-298x386.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Castle-Assault-1-620x802.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Castle-Assault-1.jpg 1275w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Jennifer</strong>: Tim! What were your overall feelings on <em>Castle Assault</em>?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tim</strong>: Wow, getting right to the meat of the dang thing. I respect that. On the whole, I liked <em>Castle Assault</em>. The most basic thing I could say is that it is different. Meaning, even if the game wasn&#8217;t good or fun I would still like it since it is a unique thing. Fortunately, the game is good!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>J</strong>: Yea! I&#8217;m always a fan of deck-building games, and this one added some some fun elements that felt different from the games I&#8217;m used to in this genre. I liked that there was an actual castle and battlefield involved in the game strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>T</strong>: Right, many CCGs don&#8217;t really have boards, so actually having an illustrated battlefield was a nice touch. It helped keep everything straight as we played. Let&#8217;s give a quick overview of <em>Castle Assault</em> shall we? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Castle Assault</em> is a 1-2 player CCG made by Momentum Volsk. Each player picks a Warband and battles their opponent head to head in an attempt to destroy each other&#8217;s castles. If you get your monsters to your opponent&#8217;s castle &#8211; BOOM &#8211; you do damage to your sworn enemy’s headquarters. If they take too much damage, they lose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>J</strong>: There&#8217;s also single-player mode where you can play against a big bad boss! The general mechanics are the same, but it&#8217;s nice to have this option even if you don&#8217;t have a friend (or foe) available to rumble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>T</strong>: Very true. Mechanically, <em>Castle Assault</em> works a little bit like <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> mixed with <em>Clash Royale</em>. You can only place your units in specific lanes on the board and they charge down the battlefield attempting to assault the castle on the other side. But, the twists that are added are real neat. The one that really stuck with me was how you gained &#8220;mana&#8221; (it isn&#8217;t called mana) that you use to summon units and to cast skills. Instead of putting resources in your deck to be randomly drawn and played, you &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; a card in your hand to become a part of a resource pool that you use throughout the rest of the game. It is a cool mechanic that keeps the game moving and avoids every CCG player’s fear &#8211; not having any options to do anything and stalling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>J</strong>: Having to decide which of your playable cards to sacrifice to the Resource God is one of many strategic decisions that you&#8217;ll need to make as you play the game. Another aspect of <em>Castle Assault</em> that I enjoyed was the way card movement is handled. Once you &#8220;ready” a card on the battlefield, in most cases, that unit will keep moving whether you want it to or not! Which is just one more thing to keep in mind as you place your units and get them ready to fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>T</strong>: This was really interesting for my Undead Horde. It felt like a slow creeping march of zombies swarming their way to Jennifer&#8217;s Castle. Plus, being undead and all, I could set up much slower creatures who could reanimate my dead zombie soldiers.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-38290" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Skelington.jpg" alt="Skelington" width="378" height="270" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Skelington.jpg 1050w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Skelington-300x214.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Skelington-768x549.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Skelington-298x213.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Skelington-620x443.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>J</strong>: I played with a crowd of Rowdy Werewolves, and early on in the game it looked like I was going to easily kick some Undead Ass! The Werewolves were great at charging up the battlefield, and I thought that Tim&#8217;s puny skeleton men didn&#8217;t stand a chance against my lupine pals. Turns out that for our game, slow and steady undead was the way to go??</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>T</strong>: Yeah, I was real annoying and it was fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>J</strong>: I kept killing his dudes but they kept coming back, which is very rude in my opinion!! No one invited you to the Castle Assault party twice, Mr. Skeleton. How about you go and read some Miss Manners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>T</strong>: You could tell by the card art that my undead-boy-crew was really into being rude and stinky. Which is another rad thing about Castle Assault &#8211; all of the art is unique and each faction has a different thematic tone. We didn&#8217;t play as the humans, but many of them appeared to be anime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>J</strong>: Damn, maybe I should have played as the humans?? I could have been a beautiful anime crossbowoman. I did love my Wolf Crew though. I had a card that was a stupid dying moose that you could put on the battlefield to summon a more powerful Werewolf later, which was hilarious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>T</strong>: Some of the cards we got initially made us think &#8220;Heck, this is just for the Resource God, right? Look at it? I hate it!&#8221; Then we would formulate a plan around that specific card later. I won because I had all these small cards that made each of my attacks do a little bit more. Plus, I had a positive outlook and I just knew that the Black Vigil was more deserving than the Lunar Hunt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>J</strong>: I had a cool Lord Werewolf that had the ability to change lanes, and I was totally going to use that to destroy Tim’s castle, but alas, it was not to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img class="alignleft wp-image-38303" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jennifer-Castle-Assault-900x1200.jpg" alt="Jennifer Castle Assault" width="322" height="429" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jennifer-Castle-Assault-900x1200.jpg 900w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jennifer-Castle-Assault-225x300.jpg 225w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jennifer-Castle-Assault-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jennifer-Castle-Assault-298x397.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jennifer-Castle-Assault-620x827.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" />T</strong>: Mechanically I won by simply overwhelming Jennifer&#8217;s Werewolves. Sure, her units each did tons of damage and moved fast, but my little skelingtons could reanimate. Then I placed these weird necromancers who made everyone else stronger or even reanimated them for a second time. Then I played a ghost thing that could pass right through every unit. So, Jennifer was set to win but in a moment of bravery and tenacity I won. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>J</strong>: I hate you for this. My Werewolves were Good Boys and would be better at ruling castles than a bunch of dusty skeletons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>T</strong>: Jennifer, would you buy  <em>Castle Assault</em>, and for who?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>J</strong>: I would definitely buy this game! If you are a person who wants to up their arsenal of 2-person games, then this is a great choice. I would also say it is a good game for people who love deck-building games like <em>Dominion</em>, and want to dip their toes into beefier CCGs like <em>Magic</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>T</strong>: Agreed! We only played it once, and our friends were giving us stink eye because they wanted to leave PAX to get lobster rolls, but despite this I have overall positive feelings. Who knows how balanced each faction is or if the depth is there. I do crave good 2 player games and from what I can tell <em>Castle Assault</em> would fit right into our ever-expanding board game collection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>J</strong>: It also seems like a game that has good expansion potential (new factions and bosses??), and I love a good board game expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>T</strong>: Yep, and out of the box there seems to be lots of replayability and customization. There are six warbands and a set of neutral cards that can be added to any warband to match your play style. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>J</strong>: Overall I really enjoyed our playthrough and would be excited to play more than just the Werewolf vs. Skeleton showdown! </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to Magic Gatherings!</p>
<p><a href="http://geeklyinc.com/magic-gatherings-35-sizing-and-archetypes-in-shadows-over-innistrad/">Last week</a> we took another look at <em>Shadows over Innistrad </em>limited with an in-depth look at the set&#8217;s creature sizes and archetypes. This week I&#8217;ll be talking about limited again, but with a twist: I&#8217;m continuing my series on draft formats from years past, as Modern Flashback Drafts have returned to <strong>Magic</strong> Online. This week&#8217;s feature? The infamous <em>Time Spiral</em>.</p>
<p>Like Kamigawa, which I covered a few months ago, <em>Time Spiral</em> is among the most controversial sets in <strong>Magic</strong>&#8216;s history. I&#8217;ll address that commentary again, but this time, I&#8217;ve opted to split my analysis into two parts: today, I&#8217;ll give an overview of the set for limited play, the better to help you run a few flashback drafts, and on Monday I&#8217;ll return with a discussion of the set&#8217;s design, execution, legacy, and controversy.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanics</strong></p>
<p><em>Time Spiral </em>was pitched as the &#8220;nostalgia set,&#8221; with a heavy dose of &#8220;time matters,&#8221; in the block design tradition of its time—in the same way that &#8220;flavor&#8221; was the bedrock of <em>Kamigawa</em> and &#8220;artifacts&#8221; were the foundation of <em>Mirrodin</em>, <em>Time Spiral</em> was all about time. Both of <em>Time Spiral</em>&#8216;s mechanics play with time and timing. (It&#8217;s the set that finally made <em>flash</em> a keyword, to boot.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38229" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Blue_ErrantEphemeron.jpg" alt="Card_Blue_ErrantEphemeron" width="223" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Blue_ErrantEphemeron.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Blue_ErrantEphemeron-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s <em>suspend</em>, a holdover from <em>Saviors of Kamigawa</em>, where it was an early contender for the slot that became the &#8220;Epic spell&#8221; mechanic. <em>Suspend</em> has a pretty simple conceit: instead of spending mana to play a spell, you spend time, in the form of a number of turns the spell is held in escrow until it finally resolves. <em>Suspend</em> has pretty nice gameplay value, once you get past the part where it&#8217;s easy to miss taking off counters in your upkeep—it lets your best creatures resolve in the middle turns, when you have mana up to protect or aid them, and it gives good value to early-turn mana, which otherwise might go to waste. It also gives both players a preview of what&#8217;s to come, which lets them make plays that are slightly more optimal, and makes both of them feel smart.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38242" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Black_SuddenDeath.jpg" alt="Card_Black_SuddenDeath" width="223" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Black_SuddenDeath.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Black_SuddenDeath-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></p>
<p>Next is <em>split second</em>, which honestly is a mechanic that probably didn&#8217;t need to exist. Essentially, it says &#8220;your opponent can&#8217;t counter or respond to this spell.&#8221; That&#8217;s a natural place for game design to go—players naturally want their spells to work <em>for sure</em>—but it&#8217;s not necessarily a good place; not being able to respond makes the game less fun for both players.  <em>S</em><em>plit second</em> fronts rules that don&#8217;t really need to be fronted, and worse, obscures rules that interact with it. Did you know that paying a <em>morph</em> cost and turning a creature face-up is a special game action that doesn&#8217;t use the stack, so you can do it in response to a <em>split second</em> spell? Lots of players don&#8217;t, and the reminder text here doesn&#8217;t tell them. (This is an important aspect of <em>Time Spiral </em>limited, though, so make sure you remember it!)</p>
<p><em><img class="size-full wp-image-38243 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Black_StranglingSoot.jpg" alt="Card_Black_StranglingSoot" width="223" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Black_StranglingSoot.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Black_StranglingSoot-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-38244 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Red_BonesplitterSliver.jpg" alt="Card_Red_BonesplitterSliver" width="223" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Red_BonesplitterSliver.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Red_BonesplitterSliver-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></em> <img class="size-full wp-image-38245 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_White_AmrouScout.jpg" alt="Card_White_AmrouScout" width="223" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_White_AmrouScout.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_White_AmrouScout-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />Beyond its new mechanics, Time<em> Spiral </em>also brought back a host of mechanics from the game&#8217;s past—<em>flanking, shadow, echo, madness, morph, flashback, </em>and more. By and large, these mechanics are limited to one color or one cycle, but the aggregate presence of so much going on can be a little overwhelming. If you played with these mechanics the first time around, enjoy experiencing them again! If some of them are new, well—we&#8217;ll talk about that in a minute.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38254" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Timeshift_FieryTemper.jpg" alt="Card_Timeshift_FieryTemper" width="223" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Timeshift_FieryTemper.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Timeshift_FieryTemper-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38255" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Timeshift_SoltariPriest.jpg" alt="Card_Timeshift_SoltariPriest" width="223" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Timeshift_SoltariPriest.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Timeshift_SoltariPriest-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38256" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Timeshift_Stormbind.jpg" alt="Card_Timeshift_Stormbind" width="223" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Timeshift_Stormbind.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Timeshift_Stormbind-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />Finally, <em>Time Spiral</em> also features a subset of 121 &#8220;timeshifted&#8221; cards—straight reprints of older <strong>Magic</strong> cards, old border and everything. They come one per pack, and you can pick them just like any other card. I&#8217;ll have more to say about the legacy of the timeshifted sheet next article, but for now, be aware that some of the cards interact well with the set&#8217;s mechanics, and others (<a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Stormbind">Stormbind</a>) are just great limited cards.</p>
<p><strong>Creature Sizing</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38257" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TSP_CreatureSizeGrid.jpg" alt="TSP_CreatureSizeGrid" width="1322" height="462" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TSP_CreatureSizeGrid.jpg 1322w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TSP_CreatureSizeGrid-300x105.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TSP_CreatureSizeGrid-768x268.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TSP_CreatureSizeGrid-1200x419.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TSP_CreatureSizeGrid-298x104.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TSP_CreatureSizeGrid-620x217.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1322px) 100vw, 1322px" /></p>
<p>As with Kamigawa, the average creature size is a little smaller than it is in modern sets. There&#8217;s a lot of creatures in the 2/2 range, but fewer sneak up into 2/3 and 3/2 than you&#8217;d see in something like <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em>. Consequently, games will take a little longer, and evasion is more important. Four toughness makes for a good blocker, and five toughness is distinctly difficult to get through; there are some four- and five-power attackers, but many come with drawbacks, or only come online in later turns.</p>
<p>One-toughness creatures are in an interesting place in this format. There are a few ways to punish them (<a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/D&#8217;Avenant Healer">D&#8217;Avenant Healer</a>, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Deathspore Thalid">Deathspore Thalid</a>, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Grapeshot">Grapeshot</a>, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Flowstone Channeler">Flowstone Channeler</a>, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Subterranean Shambler">Subterranean Shambler</a>, Saprolings, flankers). On the other hand, none of those cards are really top picks. For the most part, they&#8217;re not too risky, but keep some of the countermeasures in mind to bring in from your sideboard if you play an opponent with multiple <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Looter <em>il</em>-Kor">Looter <em>il</em>-Kor</a> or <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Crookclaw Transmuter">Crookclaw Transmuter</a>s.</p>
<p><strong>Colors and Key Cards</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38220" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_White_BenalishCavalry.jpg" alt="Card_White_BenalishCavalry" width="223" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_White_BenalishCavalry.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_White_BenalishCavalry-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>White: First up, be careful to note that <em>flanking</em>, one of white&#8217;s characteristic mechanics in <em>Time Spiral</em>, only cares when something blocks your flanker. When your flanker blocks, nothing special happens. That said, it&#8217;s a useful way for your creatures to trade up, and pushes around X/1 creatures. White&#8217;s best commons include <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Temporal Isolation">Temporal Isolation</a>, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Castle Raptors">Castle Raptors</a>, and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Amrou Scout">Amrou Scout</a>. Pay attention to creatures that are Rebels, which you can fetch with the latter. I have always liked <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Amrou Seekers">Amrou Seekers</a>—most things that can block it will have to trade. White&#8217;s uncommons are pretty stacked; <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Griffin Guide">Griffin Guide</a> and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Outrider <em>en-</em>Kor">Outrider <em>en-</em>Kor</a> are standouts, but they&#8217;re all pretty good save <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Plated Pegasus">Plated Pegasus</a> and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Pull from Eternity">Pull from Eternity</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38234" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Blue_FathomSeer.jpg" alt="Card_Blue_FathomSeer" width="223" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Blue_FathomSeer.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Blue_FathomSeer-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Blue: Blue gets <em>morph</em>. With such a low density, you can sometimes forget that morphs play face-down as a 2/2 for 3, which is a reasonable rate in this set. There&#8217;s plenty of play to them, too; something like <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Coral Trickster">Coral Trickster</a> is fine on its front half, but you&#8217;re really hoping <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Fathom Seer">Fathom Seer</a> will be a late drop to help you refuel. Don&#8217;t be fooled by <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Drifter <em>il</em>-Dal">Drifter <em>il</em>-Dal</a>. Playing this on turn one is the equivalent of blowing up your own land. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Errant Ephemeron">Errant Ephemeron</a> is probably the best blue creature, even though it looks unexciting. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Looter <em>il</em>-Kor">Looter <em>il</em>-Kor</a> and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Crookclaw Transmuter">Crookclaw Transmuter</a> are also great. The latter can target itself, so you can flash it in to pick off a 2/1 attacker.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38237" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Black_DarkWithering.jpg" alt="Card_Black_DarkWithering" width="223" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Black_DarkWithering.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Black_DarkWithering-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Black: Black has <em>madness</em>, so everyone who&#8217;s drafted <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em> should feel right at home. Be sure to pick up discard outlets: <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Trespasser <em>il</em>-Vec">Trespasser <em>il</em>-Vec</a> is a decent one, but spellshapers in other colors will do the trick too. (In black, there&#8217;s <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Urborg Syphon-Mage">Urborg Syphon-Mage</a>, which is legitimate win condition for a slower deck.) Black gets very nice removal and solid blockers in <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Gorgon Recluse">Gorgon Recluse</a> and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Cyclopean Giant">Cyclopean Giant</a> (which trades with most creatures). <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Corpulent Corpse">Corpulent Corpse</a> is a good win condition, and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Mindstab">Mindstab</a> puts opponents in a fair bind: play spells, and risk pitching the rest of your hand when <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Mindstab">Mindstab</a> resolves, or do nothing, and fall behind. At uncommon, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Nightshade Assassin">Nightshade Assassin</a> joins the common <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Tendrils of Corruption">Tendrils of Corruption</a> as a great reason to be mono-black. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Evil Eye of Urborg">Evil Eye of Urborg</a> is pretty tough to block, though its attacking restriction means your opponent might be able to chump for a while.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38240" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Red_FlamecoreElemental.jpg" alt="Card_Red_FlamecoreElemental" width="223" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Red_FlamecoreElemental.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Red_FlamecoreElemental-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Red: Red&#8217;s weaker than the other colors. It gets <em>echo</em> to itself, which isn&#8217;t anything to get excited about, although <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Flamecore Elemental">Flamecore Elemental</a> is quite large for the format. At uncommon, watch for <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Thick-Skinned Goblin">Thick-Skinned Goblin</a>, though make sure you actively choose to pay 0: the <strong>Magic</strong> Online interface isn&#8217;t the best here. Red&#8217;s got good removal in <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Lightning Axe">Lightning Axe</a> and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Rift Bolt">Rift Bolt</a>, but its creatures are a bit weak outside of <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Keldon Halberdier">Keldon Halberdier</a>. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Bonesplitter Sliver">Bonesplitter Sliver</a> can end games quickly, but remember it will give the bonus to your opponent&#8217;s slivers too. Between <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Coal Stoker">Coal Stoker</a> and <em>suspend</em>, there&#8217;s a bit of a <em>storm</em> theme. At uncommon, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Undying Rage">Undying Rage</a> is a meaningful size upgrade, and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Sulfurous Blast">Sulfurous Blast</a> and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Firemaw Kavu">Firemaw Kavu</a> are among the best uncommons in the set.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38241" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Green_ThallidGerminator.jpg" alt="Card_Green_ThallidGerminator" width="223" height="310" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Green_ThallidGerminator.jpg 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Card_Green_ThallidGerminator-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Green: As in Kamigawa, green is mostly trading on the size of its creatures, like <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Durkwood Baloth">Durkwood Baloth</a> and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Havenwood Wurm">Havenwood Wurm</a>. The latter is very expensive, but green also offers <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Gemhide Sliver">Gemhide Sliver</a> as an excellent &#8220;mana elf&#8221; to ramp—don&#8217;t confuse it for a &#8220;Slivers only&#8221; card. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Mwonvuli Acid-Moss">Mwonvuli Acid-Moss</a> can be a big swing if you power it out early. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Penumbra Spider">Penumbra Spider</a> represents a lot to punch through. Meanwhile, the Thalid deck can also be good, and you don&#8217;t even necessarily need <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Sporesower Thalid">Sporesower Thalid</a> to kick it off. Once you&#8217;re on that plan, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Strength in Numbers">Strength in Numbers</a> starts looking attractive. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Tromp the Domains">Tromp the Domains</a>, at uncommon, is always good. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Herd Gnarr">Herd Gnarr</a> is a pretty subtle one: as a (usually) 4/4 attacker, it&#8217;s not bad, but with enough Saproling generation or <em>suspend</em>, it can get very large very fast.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Archetypes</strong></p>
<p>Most <em>Time Spiral</em> limited decks are less &#8220;archetypal&#8221; and more &#8220;a color pair with a plan.&#8221; While you draft, pay particular attention to whether your deck is shaping up as primarily aggressive or primarily defensive, and choose cards accordingly. That said, there are a few particularly prominent synergies to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Slivers</em>—Slivers are evenly distributed among all the colors, but it&#8217;s easiest to base a Sliver deck in green, thanks to <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Gemhide Sliver">Gemhide Sliver</a>. From there, it&#8217;s natural to pair with red, which offers the power-boosting <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Bonesplitter Sliver">Bonesplitter Sliver</a> and the evasive <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Two-Headed Sliver">Two-Headed Sliver</a>. At uncommon, the color pair offers <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Firewake Sliver">Firewake Sliver</a>, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Might Sliver">Might Sliver</a>, and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Fury Sliver">Fury Sliver</a>.

<li><em>Blue-Black</em>—<a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Looter <em>il-</em>Kor">Looter <em>il-</em>Kor</a> sets up <em>madness</em> well, and the colors share <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Mystical Teachings">Mystical Teachings</a>. It&#8217;s is surprisingly castable in a dedicated control deck, and has a host of good targets—<a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Dark Withering">Dark Withering</a>, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Careful Consideration">Careful Consideration</a>, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Cancel">Cancel</a>, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Think Twice">Think Twice</a>, and more. Black&#8217;s heavy discard suite does a lot to help take control of the game.</li>

<p>As you might have already guessed from those descriptions, though, there&#8217;s no rigid plan you&#8217;re locked into. Much more important is picking cards that work well together, and building an overall plan for your deck. As I mentioned above, <em>Time Spiral</em> has lots of mechanics running around, which gives the set a Cube-like feel. (It&#8217;s no accident that <em>Modern Masters</em> sets have tapped into <em>Time Spiral</em> mechanics and archetypes like Rebels, Thallids, and <em>suspend</em>.) Moreover, the set has a high number of playable cards, and more still that are sometimes unplayable, but occasionally great. Be on the lookout for cards to combine in novel ways, and be willing to experiment.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for this article! I definitely recommend giving <em>Time Spiral </em>draft a try—it&#8217;s a fun format, if one that&#8217;s sometimes dense. I&#8217;ll be back Monday to talk about the set&#8217;s lasting reputation in that regard.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you need a little more limited guidance, check out <a href="http://www.starcitygames.com/tags/JeroenRemie/2006-10-16/2006-10-20">these Star City articles</a> by yesteryear limited expert Jeroen Remie. Good luck! And may time be ever on your side.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A deity of Destruction, terrible dreams, and a couple of concerts—it’s episode four of Season Crystal!</p>
<p>Rei, our favorite resident psychic, has been having apocalypse-y dreams and thinks they shouldn’t collect the talismans, but Haruka’s voice keeps saying to do so. No one is sure what’s going on, especially not Usagi and Mamoru. Mamoru has also been a focus for these dreams (although everyone’s been having them somewhat), but he doesn’t know what to make of them, and he gets distracted by the mysterious Michiru—not genuinely, romantically distracted, just…caught off guard, I suppose. She is a super hot famous violinist who they all knew in their previous lives, after all.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-38198" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.39.27-AM-1200x750.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-06 at 8.39.27 AM" width="729" height="456" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.39.27-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.39.27-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.39.27-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.39.27-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.39.27-AM-620x388.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.39.27-AM.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /></p>
<p>Usagi has a similar reaction but with more confusion, since she sees Haruka as a man and a woman, and everyone else sees her as a threat. But no matter, because Haruka invites everyone to Michiru’s recital. Y…ay?</p>
<p>This Haruka/Usagi and Mamoru/Michiru thing is kinda obnoxious and I hope it doesn’t go on too long. I liked it better when Usagi crushed on everyone—on the guy from the arcade, on Tuxedo Mask, on anyone remotely cute. This feels all grim and serious. The original had a much better sense that Usagi was 14 and prone to daydreams and infatuations.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-38199" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.40.26-AM-1200x750.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-06 at 8.40.26 AM" width="730" height="457" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.40.26-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.40.26-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.40.26-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.40.26-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.40.26-AM-620x388.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.40.26-AM.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></p>
<p>The girls, after deciding that it was weird and ominous that they all had the same talisman dream, decide they want to see Mimi Hanyu (Mimette) at Mugen Hall. But Usagi has tickets to Michiru and gives them out instead.</p>
<p>Mamoru is disappointed that he can’t share his ticket with Usagi &#8211; oh god the classic comedy of errors, almost as bad as an O. Henry story. He wasn’t flirting with Michiru, he was getting tickets for Usagi! Usagi wasn’t flirting with Haruka, she was…well, I’m not sure exactly what she was doing. Or what Haruka was doing. Their interactions are charged, but still ambiguous.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-38200" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.42.41-AM-1200x750.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-06 at 8.42.41 AM" width="732" height="458" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.42.41-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.42.41-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.42.41-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.42.41-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.42.41-AM-620x388.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.42.41-AM.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" /></p>
<p>Chibi-Usa treks over to Mugen to see Hotaru and return the handkerchief she used as a bandage. Hotaru invites her in for some tea. She has an attack and asks for the Tairion crystal. She then says something vague about becoming what she’s not. Chibi-Usa shrugs at being urged to go away, and instead gives Hotaru her crystal, the Silver Crystal. The Silver Crystal heals her and makes her feel better, so score one for love and friendship. The girls, united by secrets and empathy, seem to become friends here. Plus, pinky touching! They pinky promise each other to keep secrets! It’s so cute, and given that it’s a pinky thing, it might even be romantic.</p>

<p>Chibi-Usa heads out a little later, only to be confronted by…a helicopter. Wha—? Of course it’s Haruka (in a dress!) and Michiru, but why exactly are they landing in the middle of the street? This is very illegal, friends! Chibi-Usa don’t care, though. Since she can somehow hear Hotaru over the helicopter, she decides to trust her from the sentence “Usagi maybe doesn’t know us, but we know her very well,” because that’s definitely the kind of thing normal people say, and not serial killer stalker nutjobs. And she <em>gets in the helicopter</em>. What the hell? Does this child have no sense?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-38202" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.44.35-AM-1200x750.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-06 at 8.44.35 AM" width="729" height="456" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.44.35-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.44.35-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.44.35-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.44.35-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.44.35-AM-620x388.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.44.35-AM.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /></p>
<p>Oh, wait, she’s Usagi’s child. So that’s a no.</p>
<p>They talk about amulets and talismans, and Michiru says that her mirror is a talisman. Dun dun dunnnn. Chibi-Usa can’t and doesn’t do more than take that statement in, and then skips off to join Mamoru at the concert. Since Mamoru can’t take Usagi as his date, he brings his daughter. Aww. They’re doing a good job with the familial relationship, anyway. Mamoru and Usagi meet at the theater. For boyfriend and girlfriend—and eternal soulmates—they sure don’t communicate much or well. But they all get seated and all is well enough.</p>
<p>Except for Minako, who doesn’t give a fart about a violinist (which, fair) and sneaks off to go see Mimette across the way. (What kind of concert hall schedules a classical concert and what appears to be a wildly popular idol on the same night? Oh, never mind.) Minako has a crescent moon compact from her Sailor V days (SO. AWESOME.), which she uses to transform herself into a male Mugen student. Wow, the gender portrayals are even wilder in Crystal than they are in the original! I love it, and I love so, so much that Venus is getting a chance to shine.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-38203" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.45.45-AM-1200x750.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-06 at 8.45.45 AM" width="729" height="456" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.45.45-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.45.45-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.45.45-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.45.45-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.45.45-AM-620x388.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-8.45.45-AM.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /></p>
<p>Mimette, however, does not. She was so cute and funny in the original, but now she barely gets five minutes of stage time (pun sort of intended). They’re making the Witches 5 unbearably homogenous, letting costume design stand in for character. She does her enchant-the-students thing, and Venus pops up to stop her after calling in the cavalry. (Hey, they actually use the communicators!)</p>

<p>I love they they pit Mimette and Minako against one another as idols, since Minako’s ultimate goal was/is to become an idol when she grows up. I wish we could have had more of that, and more of the fight, and more Mimette…sigh. But she dies in record time, thanks to the Inner Senshi and thanks also to Neptune and Uranus.</p>
<p>When the pair show up (despite…doing a concert around the bend? How did Michiru leave the stage, I wonder?), it’s pretty amazing. The pacing of the fight isn’t perfect, but it’s still dramatic and exciting, so all credit to the writers and animators for this. It’s been a pretty good episode on its own merits, I suppose, so until next time,</p>

<p>The day we&#8217;ve all (well maybe except Lord Tennyson) been waiting for has finally arrived! Season 3 is here and boy oh boy did it come in firing on all cylinders. Ives is in Murray Manor doing her best impression of an emo teen, Sir Malcolm is in Africa, Ethan is in chains on a train, and Frankenstein has reunited with an old friend. If all of that weren&#8217;t fantastic enough this episode also drops a huuuuge bombshell as it cuts to black. Daddy issues, stuffed animals and brigands abound and we&#8217;re excited to talk about it with our special guest host. What are you still reading for, go listen already! Or you could get your teeth fixed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We begin with a confrontation in which the Sailor Guardians ask reasonable questions, make reasonable deductions, and are met by some violent violin skills. It’s Sailor Moon Crystal!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-38208" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.08-AM-1200x750.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-06 at 9.03.08 AM" width="727" height="455" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.08-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.08-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.08-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.08-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.08-AM-620x388.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.08-AM.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></p>
<p>In keeping with the tradition of Michiru and Haruka being aloof and mysterious, all questions—who are you, what are you doing here, are you going to hurt us?—go unanswered except for the most obvious: yes, these are the Sailors Neptune and Uranus. The Senshi guess on their own that they’re here for the Death Busters and that the mirror is one of the talismans. But, growing bored or concerned or who-the-hell-knows, Michiru takes out her violin and screeches them into paralysis. Then, Uranus world-shakes them into oblivion. Hey, these guys are jerks!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-38209" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.35-AM-1200x750.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-06 at 9.03.35 AM" width="725" height="454" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.35-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.35-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.35-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.35-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.35-AM-620x388.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.03.35-AM.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></p>
<p>So sayeth the Inner Senshi, anyway, who decide that if they come across the Outers again, there’s gonna be a rumble. That’s quite reasonable. Usagi being Usagi, thinks that’s a terrible plan and that everyone should get along. Because this is Sailor Moon, that point of view is: (a) appealing and (b) going to be possible. Good job to the production team for making this somewhat believable, although I think my nostalgia/affection is really doing most of the hard work here. If I had never seen Sailor Moon before, this stance would seem laughably naive.</p>
<p>Yada yada yada more ominous dreams about destruction and the talismans. The atmosphere surrounding these dreams isn’t terribly ominous, but maybe I just feel indifferent because I know roughly what’s going to happen.</p>

<p>Usagi definitely recognizes that Haruka is Uranus now, and begs her for more information. Uranus responds by…coming on to Usagi. Strong. Jesus, it’s unsettling. And, while I’m pretty pleased to hear Haruka ask “does it matter if I’m a man or a woman?”, it’s complicated by the fact that Haruka is supposed to be extremely devoted to Michiru. Oh, sure, she flirted with plenty of people in the original, but never so intensely. Never like she <em>meant </em>it. She means it here and she’s not shy about it. It’s really uncomfortable watching her invade Usagi’s personal space, get right up in her face, even though she knows Usagi has a boyfriend/eternal soulmate. And when she leaves, Usagi starts crying into Mamo’s shoulder, out of fear or anxiety or just being overwhelmed. That’s really creepy. I don’t like this version of Haruka, not one bit.</p>

<p>Chibi-Usa is making a clay pot for her art class, only she’s modeling it after the Legendary Holy Grail, which was apparently Neo Queen Serenity’s sippy cup or something. No, wait, it helped her in crises. Anyway, Chibi-Usa skips off to see Mamo, and finds her parents sitting in tense silence. Usagi is worried that Mamo is angry with her. So that’s awful, given that she didn’t do anything and Haruka all but forced another kiss on her. She apologizes for something that’s not her fault, but fortunately, Mamoru just says, “I trust you.” Then they both apologize for being jealous. Well, it could have been worse.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the creation of Chibi-Usa’s cup brings them back into synch and Mamo offers to let her stay the night. Er, isn’t she in middle school? Doesn’t her mom need to know where she is? Or, if not that, doesn’t she at least need to know where Chibi-Usa is?</p>
<p>Whatever, we live in the magical land where parents ain’t give a damn and we should be grateful that it’s not Disney, where they’d just be dead.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>finally,</em> we get to the meat of this week’s plot, with Ami-chan complaining about someone who beats her on exams. This mysterious Yui Bido introduces herself and suggests that Ami enroll in Mugen Prep as a potential student. Ami decides to go in to learn more about Mugen and everyone agrees that yes, they’ll stay at the base and just watch. Cool plan guys, no backup necessary.</p>
<p>Along their tour, they come across a miniature universe that apparently the science class created <em>as an experiment?</em> This is on par with Wesley Crusher randomly creating sentient nanites in an episode of Star Trek TNG. Just…yeah, it’s a universe in a box! Whoops! Welp, time for our next class, where we’ll be psychically reaching across time to channel one of Shakespeare’s lost plays! No big!</p>

<p>Viluy in disguise immediately susses out that Ami is a guardian. But not before she has to go report to Eudial, giving Ami a chance to do a little investigating. Ami, in a <em>totally badass move</em>, flings her pen at the security camera and disables it, even as Eudial is watching. Ami, you’re my forever girl.</p>
<div class="video"><iframe width="620" height="465" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TNzc6vxeEvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>This doesn’t prevent her from being captured, though. Viluy drags her into a computer room where she demonstrates the plan that probably took as long to think up as it did actually appearing on the screen—which is to say, about five seconds. They’re using a cram school to enchant Japanese children. That is literally what everyone would do. Japanese kids=cram school=zombies. There doesn’t even need to be magic involved.</p>
<p>Haruka and Michiru arrive just in time to save the day, distracting all these cram schoolers and freeing Ami.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-38216" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.12.40-AM-1200x750.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-06 at 9.12.40 AM" width="730" height="457" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.12.40-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.12.40-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.12.40-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.12.40-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.12.40-AM-620x388.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-9.12.40-AM.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></p>
<p>And oh my god, Ami <em>jumps out a window</em> without hesitation, calls on her power, lands in a pool, immediately transforms, and starts a battle. This is the greatest action I’ve seen in Sailor Moon, especially since Viluy is a match for her, anticipating her attacks with her own equivalent genius. She catches Mercury in a trap, but fortunately, the rest of the guardians arrive. They then have what would have been an equally cool battle, but they wasted so much time on all the dream crap that instead, Haruka just blasts them with her sword. Oh, and it’s also a talisman. Obvi. And they flee without giving any explanation. Typical!</p>

<p>Michiru’s and Haruka&#8217;s cover is apparently blown (I don’t know why, they killed Viluy, who was the only one who would have known/remembered what happened), but fortunately, we have the penultimate Outer Senshi ready to step in and take over. It’s Setsuna, our dear Pluto!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tile laying and city building games are common themes in board games. Personally, they are not a genre that gets me excited to play a board game. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quadropolis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Days of Wonder</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a tile laying, city building game that makes me </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">excited to play board games. </span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-38153 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0269.jpg" alt="rsz_img_0269" width="541" height="360" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0269.jpg 2592w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0269-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0269-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0269-1200x800.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0269-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0269-620x413.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A game of Quadropolis is played over four rounds(four comes up quite a bit in this game, rightfully so) and in each round players will select a city section from the center board using one of four architects. Architects range from value one through four and when placed on the side of the center board allow players to pick up the city selection that many spaces in. The city section is then placed into the player&#8217;s city board in a section corresponding again to the architect’s number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning is important because city sections score based off of what they are surrounded by or their location in the player board. A breakdown of how they score is better left for your own discovery; however, it should be pointed out that the theming of their scoring is fantastic. City sections also give you either people or energy. Allocating those two resources to the proper city sections will allow players to score them at the end of the game, tiles that don’t have their resource needs met are discarded before scoring.   </span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-38155 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0281.jpg" alt="rsz_img_0281" width="556" height="370" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0281.jpg 2592w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0281-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0281-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0281-1200x800.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0281-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0281-620x413.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The choice of which tile to take, what order to take them in and where they will fit best on your board is what drives this game. So much fun can be had trying to pivot and change your strategy because you see the players aren’t the only thing influencing your city section selection: the game itself does also. Whenever a city section is taken, a piece called “The Urbanist” is moved to that empty space. A player may not place their architect so that it points at “The Urbanist”, and as this piece moves after each person’s turn it can really mess with your decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, it is worth noting that all the players in the games I played voiced concerns about analysis paralysis. You can see how each of your choices can have a big impact on a player’s end game scoring or even your next city section choice. Everyone voiced concerns that with the wrong people this game could drag on. No choice in the game feels as if it could cripple your game, but I think the onus is on the players to realize that and not crunch the numbers that intensely.</span><br />
<img class="wp-image-38154 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0274.jpg" alt="rsz_img_0274" width="494" height="329" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0274.jpg 2592w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0274-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0274-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0274-1200x800.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0274-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rsz_img_0274-620x413.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now everything I have stated in this review applies to the “Classic” version of the game. Included in the box is a version called “Expert” and boy she pops is it a madhouse of a game. Two new city sections are added, however they are not the biggest thing. The “Expert” version adds a fifth district to your player board and changes the layout of those districts. Architects are also now selected from a communal pool and range from one to five. Minor changes like this are very impactful to the game and give this game some legs. Changes to the game like this are what I would like to see in the eventual expansions. Adding in new tiles to score is not the way to keep the game interesting.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Quadropolis is a really fun and accessible game. As a seasoned board gamer I got as much fun out of Quadropolis as I do from heavy Euro or deep strategic games. The strong components will surely hold up to the many plays it is sure to see. I can see this game standing right next Ticket to Ride as one of the easiest to learn and strategic games in history.</span></p>

<p>The Abridged Drunks and Dragons is our attempt to making getting into the DnD Podcast easier for new listeners. Episodes have been boiled down to around 10 &#8211; 20 minutes. All the important story bits, and even more important goofs and tangents have been left in for your enjoyment.</p>
<p>This original version of this episode is <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/drunks-and-dragons-episode-25-acid-trip/">Drunks and Dragons Episode 25</a>.</p>
<h5>Synopsis from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Drunks_and_Dragons_Episodes">Drunks and Dragons Wiki</a>:</h5>
<blockquote><p>The party fights <a title="Xavier Thumble" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Xavier_Thumble">Xavier Thumble</a> and many, many guards to get out of the vault. <a title="Blood Drinker" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Blood_Drinker">Blood Drinker</a> tells <a title="Thom the Dragonborn" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Thom_the_Dragonborn">Thom the Dragonborn</a> that there is a switch on the stuffed dragon that will open acid pits in the floor. Opening the pits goes fairly well for them until both Tum and Junpei fall in the pits and take a lot of acid damage. At the end of the battle Junpei has a mental break and fights Thom for the rights to Xavier&#8217;s head. Junpei eventually gets the head and eats Xavier&#8217;s brains. This is less than ideal for the rest of the party.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t familiar with the concept, Free Comic Book Day happens every year on the first Saturday of May at your local comic shop. Most stores run special sales, have costume contests, and of course, the titular free comic books. &#8220;Wait, my local store does this every year?&#8221; you might be asking. <a href="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/storelocator" target="_blank">It&#8217;s highly likely</a>! Celebrating it&#8217;s 15th year, Free Comic Book Day&#8217;s mission is to show people who don&#8217;t normally shop at comic book stores how awesome the experience can be. And what better way to get you in the door than with free stuff?</p>
<p>&#8220;So I can take any comic off the shelf for free?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen this asked a lot and no, that&#8217;s not quite how it works. You see, every year a selection of special FCBD issues are sent to stores. Some are issue zeros that give backstory and introduce you to a series. Some are reprints of an #1 in case you missed it the first time around. Some are collections of a few different comics all from the same publisher. Make sure you check with your local shop for their rules on how many comics you are allowed to take. And remember, those free comics are free for you and me, but the shop still had to pay to get them. Make sure you buy something cool to go along with your freebies if you can. It&#8217;s not required, but it&#8217;s always appreciated.</p>
<p>Since a bunch of us here at GeeklyInc are comic nerds, we wanted to share what we love about Free Comic Book Day. And don&#8217;t forget you can see the complete list of available free books on <a href="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/Home/1/1/27/981" target="_blank">the official website</a>!</p>

My wife and I have been going to Everett Comics here in Washington state for years. Pretty much ever since we were married and Brittany got a job across the street from them. They always make Free Comic Book Day an event. Costume contests, sales, raffles, super-hero themed treats; basically anything you can think of to make it a fun time for the whole family. Last year, the kids and I even won the group category in their costume contest.</p>

<p>I always try to keep my eye out for stuff I haven&#8217;t read before or that maybe I missed the first time around. That&#8217;s why I am looking forward to picking up <em>2000 AD</em>. The cover features Dredd and it promises to be &#8220;Forty-eight pages of thrill-drenched Sci-Fi from Britain&#8217;s greatest comic!&#8221; That&#8217;s definitely something I can get behind. There is also a special FCBD issue of <em>The Tick</em> that I&#8217;d love to get my hands on. If you don&#8217;t know, <em>The Tick</em> is a great super-hero comedy. It has also been a cartoon and live-action show starring Patrick Warburton in the past. Since the whole family will be with me, I&#8217;m happy to say the collection of kid friendly comics looks like it&#8217;s better than ever, with S<em>trawberry Shortcake #0</em>, <em>DC Super Hero Girls</em>,<em> Pokemon</em>, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Kieran:<br />
</strong>I love Free Comic Book day. Not only is it a sign that my birthday is just around the corner, it’s a day dedicated to some of my most favorite things. Reading, comics, charity, and being really cheap. This year’s Free Comic Book Day is shaping up to be quite excellent with some interesting, less conventional titles on offer amongst the usual cartoon tie-ins. FCBD at my local shop (Heroes for Sale on Karangahape Road for any of you who happen to be in New Zealand) is a great time. Costumes are encouraged and rewarded with more comics, while local game-makers and artists make an appearance and interact with fans. My local store also uses FCBD to raise money for charity, with every gold coin getting you 2 comics and dropping into a bucket for KidsCan. Charity and costumes aside (and even comics aside really), what I really love about FCBD is the sheer number of people who get involved. It’s just plain fantastic to see so many people getting fired up and excited about reading and getting into comics, and that to me is what the whole day is really about.</p>
<p>This weekend I’ll be looking to pick up Joe Benitez’s <em>Lady Mechanika</em>, a steampunk-infused, lady-led mystery set in Victorian England. I’m also fairly intrigued by Grant Morrison’s <em>Avatarex: Destroyer of Darkness</em>, partly because Grant Morrison is excellent, but also because the idea of an apocalypse fighting super-being lost in time is just plain bananas. And because I also use FCBD to pick up some weird things, I’ll also be getting a copy of Luke Pearson’s <em>Hilda</em>, a cartoony adventure through a magical forest. Super stuff.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38171" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/civil-war-ii.jpg" alt="civil-war-ii" width="250" height="380" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/civil-war-ii.jpg 250w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/civil-war-ii-197x300.jpg 197w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>

<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />
Free Comic Book Day is a day I usually forget about. This year is the first that I will be celebrating, and I&#8217;m pretty excited about it. My local comic shop (Mayhem in Des Moines if you are interested) has always been extremely friendly to new comic book readers like myself. This year there are costume contests and a raffle for tickets to the upcoming Wizard World con in town, so even without the draw of free books, the store will surely see a crowd. As I mentioned, the world of comic books is pretty new to me. I just started reading them regularly about a year ago, so I like to think my enthusiasm makes up for a lack of experience. For me, the reason FCBD is so exciting is that I get to pick up a bunch of books that normally I wouldn&#8217;t. Though there is one book I&#8217;m particularly excited about: <em>Civil War II</em>, which pits my favorite Marvel character, Captain Marvel, against Iron Man. Now, Captain Marvel is the reason I started reading comics. Specifically Carol Danvers. To see this character on a stage as large as something like Civil War is really exciting. Regardless of what books I pick up, I know that Free Comic Book Day means getting to talk to other people who love the medium as much as I do.</p>

<h2>Justice League #49 (Darkseid War Part 9) (DC Comics)</h2>
<p><em>Writer: Geoff Johns<br />
Pencils: Jason Fabok</em></p>
<p><strong>First Impressions: </strong>Geoff Johns certainly knows how to write a climax. For the last 4 issues, <em>Justice league </em>has been building to the end of Darkseid War, and there’s still another 4 issues to go. That said, Johns isn’t coming from a particularly conventional starting point. With Darkseid having been killed by the Anti-Monitor and the Justice League filled with godly power, its anyone’s guess as to where the story will go from here. Our last issue was even more off the wall with the Earth-3 Injustice League joining forces with the Justice League, Ultraman dying at the hands of the Anti-Monitor, Ultrawoman about to give birth to <em>something</em> and Batman doing, well, whatever he damn well pleases. This month’s cover is, as per usual, incredibly good looking. However, it does seem to depict the two leagues going head to head and, I don’t want to nit-pick, but that was the plot of <em>Forever Evil</em>. While I do trust Geoff Johns, there is a real risk that with DC Rebirth only a few weeks away, <em>Justice League</em>’s last few issues may suffer.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: </strong>There is a certain art to constructing and maintaining an ensemble battle during such a large event. Geoff Johns, on the whole, is really very good at this. This time he seems to have missed the mark, which is a shame this close to the end. The birth of Ultrawoman&#8217;s baby has been building since the end of <em>Forever Evil </em>last year, and the whole thing ended up being a little disappointing. Perhaps the real issue is less the subject matter itself, but rather the sheer volume of it.</p>
<p>It feels like there is so much going on this month that no single piece of the battle is allowed to breathe. The opening idea of the whole issue is that with Darkseid dead at the hands of the Anti-Monitor, the battle field can change in unpredictable ways. Johns, like any good writer, picks this up and runs with it. He then seems to run too far with. There is, for the number of pages available, simply too many plot threads running through the battle and the entire thing begins to feel incredibly jumbled, which is quite unlike Geoff John’s normal fare. Just as we seem to settle on one portion of the battle, we switch and focus on something else. There’s no place for any ideas to breathe, and considering the number of complicated things going on and plans unveiling, John’s really needed to take his time with this one to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>While I am still eager to read next months no doubt thrilling conclusion to Darkseid War, I just couldn’t enjoy this chapter as half the time I didn’t know what was happening. A weak chapter in an otherwise stellar story.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-37883" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cl7-1-780x1200.jpg" alt="cl7" width="620" height="954" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cl7-1-780x1200.jpg 780w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cl7-1-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cl7-1-768x1181.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cl7-1-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cl7-1-620x954.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></h2>
<h2>Clean Room #7 (Vertigo)</h2>
<p><em>Writer: Gail Simone<br />
Pencils: Jon Davis Hunt</em></p>
<p><strong>First Impressions: </strong><em>Clean Room</em> has lately been all about Astrid Mueller. And that is definitely not a complaint. Gail Simone shifting Astrid from a semi-faceless, corporate, self-help overlord to a desperate and brilliant woman trying to save the planet is a killer move. As interesting as Chloe’s efforts to take down Astrid and her empire and find out why her boyfriend killed himself were, there were far too many hints at a greater, more alien threat. I can’t help but think that even though Simone is brilliant, having our protagonist, Chloe, split between two forces would just drag it all down. With Astrid beginning to come to the fore as one of our heroes, it would seem that now is the time for ‘the flashback issue’. Color me excited.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: </strong>Once again Gail Simone has proven me wrong. After 7 issues you&#8217;d think I would come to realize that I can never predict the contents of an issue of <em>Clean Room</em>. While there was indeed some flashback, including the second appearance of Anika Wells (Astrid&#8217;s employee from several issues ago) and a few scenes of Astrid as a child, it&#8217;s fairly chopped up and seems to jump from time to time and place to place. Simone taking us on a jaunt through Astrid&#8217;s past and the eventual taunting by the ever creepy Surgeon near the end is undoubtedly the A-plot. However, it&#8217;s the B-plot that has me intrigued.</p>
<p>Far, far back in issue one, Detective Avil Demakos remarked on the number of suicides associated with Astrid Mueller. Now 6 issues later, he&#8217;s reappeared, and it would seem he and Chloe are about to embark on a team up. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing Chloe having a little more to do other than be carted around being confused and frightened. She is in some ways a reader proxy, and now that we&#8217;ve spent some time wondering, we&#8217;re ready to start getting some answers.</p>
<p>My only real gripe with the issue is that, while Simone does a great job of hinting and teasing at plot lines to come and is no doubt all set to press go on a new round of excellence, nothing really happens this issue. It feels like filler. That said, it is still <em>Clean Room</em>, so it’s good filler. I’m looking forward to next month where once again Gail Simone will no doubt defy my expectations and make me look foolish.</p>

<p>This was an episode of Game of Thrones alright. This is probably the most surprising episode of any season so far. We had so much movement in plot lines that have been dragging on for years now.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blindspot &#8211; In the Comet of Us<img class="size-medium wp-image-37928 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aca7447ef578f6d23892858c620f-300x200.jpg" alt="Blindspot - Season 1" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aca7447ef578f6d23892858c620f-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aca7447ef578f6d23892858c620f-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aca7447ef578f6d23892858c620f-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aca7447ef578f6d23892858c620f-620x414.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aca7447ef578f6d23892858c620f.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span></strong><br />
Hey, there&#8217;s nothing like starting an episode with a joke at the expense of a massively popular game with players who are one of the show&#8217;s target demographics. Thanks, <em>Blindspot</em> writers. I&#8217;m glad that you don&#8217;t mind exploiting gamer stereotypes for a punchline. The joke was funny and fitting to the character, but it was cheap. Last week&#8217;s episode wasn&#8217;t the best and this episode didn&#8217;t start out much better. I honestly didn&#8217;t like it at all when I first started watching. The FBI team made some bad choices when dealing with the situation, for no explanation or reason other than it needed to happen to drive the plot. And then some more weird things happens, like Weller scaling the building. Also, the eventual reveal of what was happening seemed confusing. This was a &#8220;ripped from the headlines&#8221; moment, even if it did come a few years late. The situation was tragic and, unfortunately, all too real. But the point was made that the victims didn&#8217;t plan to hurt anyone. The weapons and bombs make that point difficult to accept. This point is small, and can be explained away by the impact of trauma. This episode also seemed to continue to pattern started last week of focusing on individual character stories. I didn&#8217;t like it last week, and I started out not liking it this week either. But as this episode played out, the style grew on me. I ended up enjoying it. There weren&#8217;t any great moments (except that tailor scene) but there wasn&#8217;t anything entirely terrible. I did enjoy a few of the character facts that were revealed. Overall, it was another one of those &#8220;nothing happens&#8221; episodes, which is unfortunate. By this point in the season, I need to see more development of the actual mystery. Also, the one thing that really bugged me was the paper bag full of cash. Given the fact that this scene seemed to happen on the same day, there&#8217;s absolutely no way that a bank would simply hand over that much cash, or even have it available. Silly, I know. But it&#8217;s just something that ruins the reality of the show.</p>

The finale of <em>Lucifer</em> comes with no resolution or explanation. Instead, it delivers awkward exchanges, laughably bad police drama, a pointless brawl, and a poor attempt at a cliff hanger that tries and fails to deepen the plot. This episode is a great demonstration of everything wrong with Lucifer. The police drama side of things falls flat. It lacks quality and does nothing to engage the audience. Things just happen. There&#8217;s no sense of continuity. The supernatural genre side of things is equally lacking. The facts are ill-defined. Instead of supporting or driving the plot, they are just confusing. Facts are randomly presented without any logic. This element is based upon a mythology that the average person is very familiar with, but core aspects are changed without explanation. Yes, <em>Lucifer</em> has the right to establish its own fictional rules and continuity. However, the show has no clear foundation. One of the two main elements of the show (police drama or supernatural genre) has to be solid for a mash-up show like <em>Lucifer</em> to function successfully. My opinion aside, however, <em>Lucifer</em> is somehow popular. The cast has an entertaining dynamic. The concept is engaging to a casual viewer who doesn&#8217;t over-analyze the core components. There is a certain appeal to the premise of <em>Lucifer</em>, and the beautiful people acting at each other makes the show easy on the eyes. I wish that the show had more substance than flash. The supernatural or urban fantasy genre is making a comeback. I am very happy with this. But I also feel that shows like <em>Lucifer</em>, while appealing to the average viewer, are hurting the genre more than helping it. I hope that there is an improvement in the next season.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supernatural &#8211; The Chitters<img class="size-medium wp-image-37930 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d21b5d855f0e421f8824b0ae71114cd3-300x221.jpg" alt="d21b5d855f0e421f8824b0ae71114cd3" width="300" height="221" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d21b5d855f0e421f8824b0ae71114cd3-300x221.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d21b5d855f0e421f8824b0ae71114cd3-298x220.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d21b5d855f0e421f8824b0ae71114cd3.jpg 475w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span></strong><br />
It&#8217;s been a long time since the Winchesters ran into other hunters. It was a part of the show that I always enjoyed. And specifically in this episode, I enjoyed both the relationship that these new hunters shared and that they were able to find a happy ending to their struggle. The Winchesters have been cursed for the last few seasons with on-going problems. When <em>Supernatural</em> first started, the boys had a clear agenda and a direct plot to follow. The ultimate resolution of that plot expanded and took some strange turns, but there was still a logical continuity from season to season. Recently, however, each resolution has introduced another bigger and more dangerous opponent. There&#8217;s an attempt at logical progression, but it&#8217;s a stretch. The hunters in this episode reminded me of the Winchesters back in the early seasons. They were focused and dedicated. And instead of getting involved in another problem, they found happiness after achieving their resolution. Obviously, this can&#8217;t work for the Winchesters because then there would be no <em>Supernatural</em>. But it&#8217;s nice to see that the fictional world of Supernatural isn&#8217;t equally depressing for everyone. Other than that, this was a typical monster of the week filler episode. There was the required mention of the larger plot at the start and end. As always, this plot format works for <em>Supernatural</em>, but it is frustratingly predictable. I want the resolution of the Darkness plot line, even though I absolutely know that either it will stretch into next season or will yet again spawn another bigger problem. Lately, the best parts of <em>Supernatural</em>, except for a few randomly entertaining episodes, have been the season premiers and finales. I&#8217;m looking forward to what I hope will continue this trend.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-37931 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/arrow-04x19-b-0045b-178017-300x210.jpg" alt="Canary Cry" width="300" height="210" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/arrow-04x19-b-0045b-178017-300x210.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/arrow-04x19-b-0045b-178017-298x208.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/arrow-04x19-b-0045b-178017-620x434.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/arrow-04x19-b-0045b-178017.jpg 655w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arrow &#8211; Canary Cry</span></strong><br />
Tragedy aside, I&#8217;m really bothered by the fact that this random doctor is now aware of at least two of Team Arrow&#8217;s secret identities. And people in the <em>Arrow</em> universe are very capable of figuring out who&#8217;s behind the mask when a few details are revealed and connected. But that&#8217;s a minor complaint. A bigger problem is Lance&#8217;s wig in the flashbacks. <em>Arrow</em> does not have a good history with wigs. But again, these are very minor issues in a show that I very much enjoy. This was an intensely emotional episode. I am not ashamed to say that I felt the impact of this sorrow. <em>Arrow</em> has always been about the people behind the masks. It is a testament to the skill of the writers and actors that this loss can be felt with such realness. While ultimately nothing happened in this episode to advance the larger plot, it was not a disappointment. This episode was about character development. It was about dealing with loss and blame and sorrow. It was about turning those emotions into dedication towards achieving resolution. It was also, unfortunately, about delivering a big gaping plot hole. The mysterious girl that took on the Canary identity was never explained. I hope that happens soon. I also refuse to believe that Laurel will stay dead. The nature of her death in the hospital was far too suspicious and there&#8217;s too much magic being thrown around. But that being said, I hope that she is not brought back. I think that it will cheapen the events of this episode.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Flash &#8211; Back to Normal<img class="size-medium wp-image-37932 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/fla219a_0076b-300x200.jpg" alt="fla219a_0076b" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/fla219a_0076b-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/fla219a_0076b-768x513.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/fla219a_0076b-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/fla219a_0076b-620x414.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/fla219a_0076b.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span></strong><br />
Watching the team deal with a villain of the week without the Speedforce was interesting. And the episode remained entertaining and engaging even with out the super speed. But the show doesn&#8217;t work without the Flash being the Flash, so of course there&#8217;s going to be some science magic whipped up to get Barry his speed back. Furthermore, with this development in the works, there&#8217;s a really good chance that the other potential speedsters that have been introduced are going to get a chance at joining the fight. Speaking of fighting, now that Zoom has been unmasked, I think that he&#8217;s less of a threatening villain Yes, he has the power. But now his motivation is known. As I mentioned last week when the reveal occurred, he is no-longer a compelling character. He&#8217;s just a crazy guy with super speed. I&#8217;m still looking forward to the ultimate show down, but Zoom is not the imposing figure of terror that he was previously. More than anything, I want to know the identity of the guy in the mask. I&#8217;m disappointed that for all her intelligence, Caitlin couldn&#8217;t figure out his coded tapping. This also makes me want to try to decode it myself. Maybe someone on the interwebs has already done so. I don&#8217;t doubt for a second that the season finale will deliver a resolution for the Zoom confrontation while revealing another larger source of danger from the multiverse. Given how well <em>Flash</em> embraces its comic book roots, I am really looking forward to what happens next.</p>

You can mark &#8220;reverse the polarity&#8221; off your genre bingo card. And &#8220;giant robot&#8221; too, but that&#8217;s not one that I was expecting. It certainly fits the goofy nature of the show, but it doesn&#8217;t fit with the style established for Savage so far. It&#8217;s also unfortunate that the main fight was resolved in the exact same way that all fights between giant things are: with punching. Sure, there were some lasers thrown around here and there, but it all boiled down to fisticuffs. I have nothing against giant things hitting each other, but it&#8217;s a frustrating trend of the genre. There were some interesting elements of this episode. For example, how Rip is more focused on revenge than saving people. Or how by this point in the series, every character has resigned him- or herself to a very limited role. In the first few episodes, characters argued and struggled. Now they all just fulfill their jobs. There should be a sense of cooperation like this in a team-based series, but I didn&#8217;t want it to go so far so fast. This episode also featured what I think is the show&#8217;s biggest blunder. <em>Legends</em> could have very successfully explored the debate of whether or not Savage was truly a villain and if his domination over humanity was actually a bad thing. The show could have started out with Rip telling the story of how terrible Savage&#8217;s reign was, but then the heroes could have only seen his virtue. To me, Savage has always been a very subtle character. He has always played the long game and worked through other villains to disguise his ultimate plan. I think this show would&#8217;ve been so much more interesting if every time the team found Savage, he was actually doing something good. The dynamic between the team and Rip would&#8217;ve been much more intriguing. As it stands, Rip is still a liar and blinded by his focus, but since Savage is clearly the bad guy, it&#8217;s all forgivable. The big twist at the end of this episode was pretty easy to see coming and wasn&#8217;t very exciting at all. Honestly, I don&#8217;t care about the Hawk sub-plot of <em>Legends</em>. It&#8217;s the most &#8220;soap opera drama&#8221; element of the show and it hasn&#8217;t engaged me at all. Also, ending the show with Savage captured might be the biggest mistake yet. Any excitement that has been built for the ultimate Team of Legends versus Vandal Savage showdown has been destroyed by a very anti-climactic fight. Savage never could&#8217;ve stood in combat against the team, but I was anticipating a finale where Savage used his cunning and planning to effectively combat the team&#8217;s brute force. And as there are still three episodes to go in the season, the finale must either take a completely different direction or fall back on the oldest trope of all and let Savage escape. Whatever happens, I&#8217;m still interested, just disappointed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Living Campaign is a series of articles where every author has an impact on the world. Articles can focus on any part of the setting, from locations to NPCs or even events. Writers can add new elements to the world or they can build upon what already has been defined. This will be a system-agnostic series, meaning that it will provide flavor and content instead of stat blocks and monster entries.</p>
<p>The intent of this series is to provide inspiration for home games. It will draw on foundational elements from Lovecraftian fiction as well as the horror and urban fantasy genres. The ideas presented can be utilized individually, or as a whole. As the setting develops and evolves, special articles will feature story lines within the established world. But all of the content in this series is simply fodder for additional development.</p>
<p>The specific boundaries and details of this campaign setting are intentionally vague. This is done so that all contributors have absolute freedom to create whatever they wish. Authors can add in any geographic details they want, from coastlines to mountains. The city itself might contain a university, manufacturing plants, shipping docks, or any number of physical locations. The general location and time frame will be the United States in the 1920s. However, the nature of this genre lends itself to a certain flexibility. Anything can, and might, happen.</p>
<p>And with the introduction complete…welcome to New Coventry.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cornelius Weatherhorn: Character</span></p>
<p>Cornelius is a retired teacher. In his late 50s, he&#8217;s enjoying his calm, quiet life. He has no family in New Coventry. He moved to town in his youth in search of work and romance. After traveling the country, writing about small town life in this great country, he decided that he needed a steady job if he was ever going to duplicate the classic family experience that he had seen so frequently. New Coventry offered just such an opportunity, and Cornelius was a natural at sharing his knowledge and experience with students.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was not as skilled at love. Cornelius was a respectable gentleman. He did not partake of liquor and he was did not posses a temper. But no relationship could last more than six months. Small towns are full of gossip, and rumors flew. However, his reputation survived. None of his partners ever spoke ill of him, instead saying that they simply held different interests. But hushed stories still circulated that Cornelius was a peculiar man behind closed doors, with exceedingly strange behaviors and preferences.</p>
<p>When the university eventually opened, Cornelius began teaching there. He quickly gained fame as a man interested in ancient texts and writings. He taught several classes on the subject, and began traveling again to search out rare finds. Visitors to the campus would bring him old books and scrolls. His fame grew to international status, and brought a measure of prestige to the small college. He attended several renowned conferences in Europe.</p>
<p>It was after one such conference that Cornelius abruptly retired. He donated his collection to the university library and retreated to a life of seclusion in his small home outside of town. He has lived that way for 20 years. He is not a recluse, but he does enjoy his privacy. He is seen about town shopping or eating. And he enjoys taking long walks through the woods that surround New Coventry. He does visit the university occasionally, but he absolutely never sets foot in or near the library. He also will not explain any of the reasons for his actions.</p>
<p>Cornelius Weatherhorn is a friendly, well-liked member of the New Coventry community. But those rumors are starting to circulate again.</p>

<p>After a whole season without him, we are finally reunited with Bran, Meera, and Hodor. Bran has been warging with the Three-eyed Raven and seeing different visions throughout time. This time, Bran and the Three-eyed Raven are in Winterfell, watching Ned practice sword fighting with Benjen (I&#8217;m guessing the dude with the badass muttonchops was young Rodrik Cassel). They also see Bran&#8217;s aunt, Lyanna, riding in on a horse. Bran goes to get a better look at his family and sees Hodor, whose real name is Willis. Hodor has giant&#8217;s blood and can also talk! Before the Stark kids can get Hodor fighting, old Nan comes and takes Hodor away. Maybe we will find out what happened to Hodor one of these days. After seeing this much, the Three-Eyed Raven takes Bran back to their cave even though Bran wants to stay and watch his family some more. Bran complains that the Three-Eyed Raven finally showed him something he cared about but didn&#8217;t let him spend as much time as he wanted, which makes me wonder what else the Three-Eyed Raven has shown Bran. Bran is sad to have left early because was finally <em>home</em> after so long.  The Three-Eyed Raven tells Bran &#8220;it is beautiful under the sea but if you stay too long, you will drown&#8221; &#8211; Bran doesn&#8217;t belong in the world they visited, so he can&#8217;t stay there even if he was happy seeing his family.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-37913 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/got6.2ellie-300x200.jpg" alt="got6.2ellie" width="728" height="485" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/got6.2ellie-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/got6.2ellie-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/got6.2ellie-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/got6.2ellie-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/got6.2ellie.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Bran tells Hodor that he saw him as a boy and asks him what happened, to which Hodor replies, &#8220;Hodor.&#8221; Meera is by herself outside of the cave. She seems to still be mourning her brother Jojen&#8217;s death. Bran tries to tell Meera about Hodor/Willis but she&#8217;s not interested. When Bran reminds Meera about the war coming, Meera brusquely asks him if they&#8217;re going to fight the war from inside the cave. After Bran is carried back in the cave by Hodor, one of the Children of the Forest tells Meera that Bran needs her because he isn&#8217;t going to stay in this cave forever and when they&#8217;re out there, he will need her.</p>
<p>At the Wall, it is time for the men inside the room with dead Jon to open the door or fight the men of the Night&#8217;s Watch and they decide to fight. Davos grabs Longclaw and they prepare themselves while the Night&#8217;s Watch starts busting down the door. Right when they have busted a hole in the door, there is commotion at the front gates of Castle Black. Something huge is trying to break in through the front gate &#8211; its WUN WUN and the wildlings, recruited by Edd. The Night&#8217;s Watch initially starts to fight them but quickly realize that they are outnumbered. One brother still shoots an arrow at Wun Wun and is smashed into the wall. Seeing this, they lay down their arms but Alliser and Olly aren&#8217;t giving up yet &#8211; they try to charge but are quickly subdued. I was hoping Olly would die here but he didn&#8217;t. Alliser calls Edd a traitor and says that the Night&#8217;s Watch has helped Castle Black against the wildlings for a thousand years, and Tormund comes back with &#8220;until you.&#8221; Oh shit. Call 911 for that sick burn! Tormund goes to see his buddy&#8217;s body and comments on the many stab wounds Jon endured.</p>

<p>A drunk in Flea Bottom is entertaining a crowd with his story about showing his nether region to Cersei during her atonement walk and how she appreciated what he had to offer. When the dude goes off to relieve himself, FrankenGregor walks up and straight bashes his head into the wall with one push. Gangsta ass shit. FrankenGregor goes back to the Red Keep and Cersei sees the blood on his armor &#8211; he is doing what Qyburn promised FrankenGregor would do. Cersei attempts to leave the Red Keep to attend Myrcella&#8217;s funeral but Tommen has ordered her to stay in the Red Keep. The Kingsguard seem pretty scared of FrankenGregor, and I would be too &#8211; he seems ready to cut all the men down but Cersei complies and goes back to her room, with FrankenGregor following behind her, like a terrifying, huge monster puppy.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-37915 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jaimetommen-300x200.jpg" alt="jaimetommen" width="725" height="483" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jaimetommen-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jaimetommen-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jaimetommen-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jaimetommen-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jaimetommen.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></p>
<p>At the Sept, Tommen and Jaime are chatting beside Myrcella&#8217;s body. We find out that they don&#8217;t know who killed Trystane, so it means his ship must have still been in King&#8217;s Landing &#8211; did the Sand Snakes sail all that way to kill Trystane? Tommen thinks Cersei did it &#8211; or at least he knows that she&#8217;s capable of it. Tommen didn&#8217;t let Cersei come to the Sept because he was afraid they would put her in a cell again. He also hasn&#8217;t been to see her since she&#8217;s been back because, as a king, he failed to protect his mother and his wife and he is ashamed. The High Sparrow enters the Sept, and when Tommen asks to see Margaery, the High Sparrow says no can do. Jaime advises Tommen to go see Cersei and he turns to tackle the High Sparrow. When the High Sparrow says what happened with Cersei was atonement for his sins, Jaime asks him about his sins and atonement, listing off his sins including killing his king, his cousin, and helping Tyrion escape. When Jaime seemingly threatens the High Sparrow, he tells Jaime to go ahead and kill him, which takes Jaime aback. Then, the Faith&#8217;s Militant start filing into the room with their weapons, and even though they probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to save him, the High Sparrow reminds Jaime that they are poor, powerless people who have no names or families but together, they can overthrow an empire. He then drops the mic and scoots out.</p>
<p>Tommen goes to see Cersei and apologize for his behavior. Cersei tells him it&#8217;s alright but Tommen turns dark and says he should&#8217;ve killed them all and torn down the Sept before he let them do what they did to Cersei &#8211; she would&#8217;ve done that for him. Tommen wants to be strong and wants her help &#8211; Cersei looks so sad/proud of him in that moment.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-37906 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3056615-dragon-300x169.jpg" alt="3056615-dragon" width="728" height="410" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3056615-dragon-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3056615-dragon-298x167.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3056615-dragon-620x348.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3056615-dragon.jpg 655w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Tyrion has to pay attention to his audience before he makes his &#8220;no cock&#8221; jokes. There is also bad news on bad news &#8211; no one is saying who burned the ships, Astapor and Yunkai have been taken over by the Masters again, all of Slaver&#8217;s Bay &#8211; outside of Meereen &#8211; has returned to the slavers, and the dragons have stopped eating. Tyrion knows that dragons don&#8217;t do well in captivity; because of captivity, the last dragons in Westeros were no bigger than cats. He has a theory &#8211; since dragons are intelligent, they will know he is a friend and will let him take the shackles off of them. So he and Varys go down to the dungeons where the dragons are kept. The dragons don&#8217;t look tok happy to see him but he tells them that he is a friend of Dany&#8217;s. He also tells them that as a child, all he ever wanted was a dragon but was told that dragons were all dead, which made him super sad. He takes the shackle off of the first one and the second one offers him its neck, so he removes that shackle also. After that, he hurries out of there, telling Varys to punch him the next time he has a &#8220;brilliant&#8221; idea like this.</p>

<p>Arya is still a blind beggar and the Waif is still beating up on her. Arya tells her that she is no one but the Waif doesn&#8217;t believe her. Arya tries very hard to get the Waif but her stick is stopped by Jaqen, who gives her the choice of sleeping under a roof, having food, or even having her eyes back, if she just tells him her name. She turns it all down. She&#8217;s a little hesitant about her eyes, but she repeats that she has no name to all three propositions. Jaqen tells her to follow him and, when she goes to grab her begging bowl, he tells her to leave it because she is not a beggar anymore.</p>

<p>The Boltons know that Sansa and Theon got away once again, obviously with help from someone. They theorize that Sansa is headed to the Wall and Ramsay proposes attacking Castle Black on the Southern side and killing Jon Snow (he already dead, bro). Roose reminds Ramsay that attacking the Night&#8217;s Watch means uniting all the Northern Houses against them. However, Ramsay reminds Roose that they have the support of the big houses of the North, including the Umbers, Manderlays, and Karstarks, so they don&#8217;t need every house in the North to keep the North. Harald Karstark is totally down for Ramsay&#8217;s plan but Roose reminds Ramsay that if you act like a mad dog, people will put you down like a mad dog. Right at that second, the Bolton Maester comes in with news of Roose&#8217;s new baby boy&#8217;s birth. Ramsay is not happy but he goes up to hug and congratulate his father anyway, who tells Ramsay that he will always be his first born. Ramsay says that means a lot to him and then straight stabs Roose, letting him bleed out. If you foster a mad dog, Roose, it will eventually turn on you. Ramsay orders the Maester to send out news saying Roose was poisoned by him enemies. Harald is also down for what just happened.</p>

<p>Ramsay sends for Walda and her baby to be brought to meet him out in the courtyard. When they do, he takes them to the kennel saying he&#8217;s taking them to see Lord Bolton. He locks the doors behind them and opens the kennel doors. Walda promises to go back to the Riverlands and not make trouble. She pleads to him saying the child is his brother, which is the wrong thing to say to Ramsay. He tells her that he&#8217;s Lord Bolton and that he&#8217;s more of an only child. Then he sets the dogs on them, which was horrific. I cannot wait until this dude is dead.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-37911 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Game-Of-Thrones-Season-6-Episode-2-300x200.jpg" alt="Game-Of-Thrones-Season-6-Episode-2" width="726" height="484" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Game-Of-Thrones-Season-6-Episode-2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Game-Of-Thrones-Season-6-Episode-2-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Game-Of-Thrones-Season-6-Episode-2.jpg 615w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></p>
<p>Sansa, Theon, Pod, and Brienne are still in the forest. Brienne is filling Sansa in on her encounter with the Hound and Arya. She asks Sansa what happened at Winterfell and she understands without Sansa actually having to say anything. Sansa expresses regret in not going with Brienne when she had the chance but Brienne understands that it was a difficult choice. Theon is still waiting for Bolton men to hunt them down but he is equally afraid of making it to Castle Black because he is afraid to face Jon after all the wrongs he has done to the Stark family. He doesn&#8217;t want to take the Black because he doesn&#8217;t want to be forgiven for his crimes. He is leaving them to go <em>home</em> to the Iron Islands.</p>

<p>Things are not going well in Pyke. They&#8217;ve lost their hold on Deepwood Motte and also lost a lot of men. Yara/Asha is not happy about how her dad is handling things because the Greyjoys can win any battle at sea but on land is a different matter but Balon doesn&#8217;t seem to get it or chooses not to care. He is also mad that she went on a mission to rescue Theon, which didn&#8217;t end well. He walks off after telling her to obey or he will make another heir. It&#8217;s super stormy out and they have rope/wood bridges between the towers. He is trying to cross when he finds his path blocked by a hooded figure &#8211; his brother Euron, who supposedly lost his mind during a storm while out at sea. Euron tells Balon to step down and let someone new rule, and when Balon attacks Euron with a knife, Euron pushes him off the bridge and down to his death. After Balon&#8217;s funeral, Yara/Asha promises to find who killed her father and swears it by the Salt Throne but the Drowned Priest reminds her that the King&#8217;s Moot picks who rules the Iron Islands and she has not yet been chosen.</p>

<p>Davos visits Melisandre, to ask her about any magic she knows that could bring Jon back from the dead. She remembers meeting a priest who did bring a man back from the dead but she does not possess that power. She has lost her faith but Davos tells her to fuck the Gods &#8211; he knows the shit she can do and he&#8217;s asking her for help and not R&#8217;hllor. Remember though, Thoros of Myr keeps bringing back Beric Dondarrion, even though he has lost faith in R&#8217;hllor, so maybe there&#8217;s more to this magic than faith in the Lord of Light. Melisandre decides to give it a go at the urging of Davos &#8211; she washes the dirt and blood off of Jon, who has a small piece of cloth covering his twig and berries (come on, I thought this was HBO. If it was a girl, I bet everything would&#8217;ve been on display. Smh.) She cuts and throws bits of his hair and beard into the fire, washes his hair with water, and puts her hand on his torso, which has a lot of stab marks. As Edd, Tormund, and Davos watch on, she recites a spell multiple times but nothing happens. Helplessly, she whispers &#8220;please&#8221; but still nothing happens. Tormund walks out, followed by Melisandre, Edd, and then Davos, who closes the door. Ghost, who is sleeping on the floor beside the table where Jon&#8217;s body is laid out, wakes up, whining softly. Jon is still dead on the table but then he wakes up, gasping for air. JON SNOW IS BACK AND HE&#8217;S READY TO GET ROWDY. IS HE CHANGED? IF SO, HOW??</p>

<p>Well, crap. This whole trip has been one thing after another but this whole Balder being murdered bit takes the cake! Honestly, what are we going to do? We are trapped underground with thousands of angry dwarves with the only exits heavily guarded. Plus, they think Jaela did it! We brought Jaela into their city so even if she didn&#8217;t do it&#8230;they won&#8217;t care! I think the best course of action is to solve this mystery in order to prove Jaela&#8217;s innocence. Also, Jett is so cool and this will give all of us extra time to really figure him out. What is he even saying?</p>

<p>You would have thought that by now I would be used to the fact that we have one of the best communities on the internet, and yet I&#8217;m still amazed at the <em>GeeklyInc</em> community&#8217;s generosity and willingness to help those in need.</p>
<p>The 24 hour charity stream was a huge success. Everybody rallied together and we raised over $4,500 for the <em><a href="http://sundarneena.org/">Sundar and Neena Foundation</a></em> (and the total keeps rising). We sure showed those earthquakes what&#8217;s what, and every one of you literally just saved lives.</p>
<p>We gave away over $1000 worth of board games and books (kindly donated by some great game companies and members of the community), and that&#8217;s just the prizes we had for the donors. The viewers of the stream also had the chance to get some loot in the form of tabletop related games on Steam, and commissioned art pieces.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that I speak for everyone here at <em>GeeklyInc</em> and the <em>Sundar and Neena Foundation</em> when I thank everyone from the bottom of my heart for all your support during the stream. Whether you were a donor, a player, or even just gave us moral support in chat. We really couldn&#8217;t have done any of this if we didn&#8217;t have such an amazing community, so thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lin wakes up in a pile of freshly murdered bodies, with a madman screeching overhead and an army on the way and magic all around and gems—which are different from Jewels—and magic threatening everyone sanity and oh my!</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-37443" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/28097860.jpg" alt="28097860" width="250" height="400" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/28097860.jpg 250w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/28097860-188x300.jpg 188w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with dumping someone in the middle of a narrative, but it takes a judicious hand to fling someone into a fantasy world that doesn&#8217;t even operate by normal fantasy rules. Wilde&#8217;s hand falters at first, holding back too much context in favor of advancing the urgency and plot. I don&#8217;t have enough context for the simple things&#8211;what does the world look like? How do the gems and Jewels and Lapidaries interact? What exactly is this veil Lin puts on and what does it look like?&#8211;to fully immerse myself in the story. It&#8217;s not until a bit later that all the pieces come together and I get a a clear picture of the <em>what </em>and <em>how. </em>After that turning point, though, it&#8217;s strong to the finish, especially as it concerns the main characters.</p>
<p>Lin and Sima, the titular Jewel and her Lapidary, have a touching and tense relationship both as individuals and as members of their respective classes. This is an interesting dynamic not often explored, that of the lady and her handmaiden. It&#8217;s a fruitful one, too, one marked by inequality as well as mutual privilege, and by an intimacy rooted in but also transcending the political. There is further balance/imbalance between Lin and Sima because while Lin is the Jewel, a princess of the ruling royal family, Sima is actually the one who can hear and command the magical gems. Sima is bound to Lin by magically-enforced oaths of loyalty, as well as love and friendship.</p>
<p>This goes against every fantasy convention there is, to have the most powerful <em>not</em> also be the rulers. It&#8217;s a fascinating concept, and I wish the novella had spent more time on it. Still, the gist is clear: (nearly) absolute power corrupts absolutely, especially in the case of Sima&#8217;s father, who goes literally mad with it.</p>
<p>We also know from the outset, by way of the &#8220;guidebook&#8221; entries that pepper the narrative, that there are no more Jewels and no more gems. This, too, is unusual, since most fantasy is concerned with unearthing long-lost gems (both literally and figuratively—David Eddings, anyone?) and using them, not finding a way to keep them from being used. But Lin and Sima have to try, since to do otherwise is to risk the enslavement of their people. How they succeed—and fail—is the meat of the story. That&#8217;s something I always appreciate, since to me the most important thing is not the ending, but how you get there.</p>
<p>This is a worthy addition to what I can only hope will be Wilde&#8217;s growing body of work, and if you liked <em>Updraft</em> you&#8217;re sure to like this as well. (And at $3, how can you go wrong?) Wilde seems to be an author who brooks no cliches, taking even the simplest ideas in new and exciting directions. She stumbles here with initially providing details, but corrects herself in time to make a compelling and unusual story.</p>
<p><em>The Jewel and Her Lapidary</em> comes out tomorrow, May 3rd.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DC Rebirth is a new DC Comics wide event that has been touted as both the death knell and the saving grace for DC Comics. After the incredibly divisive New 52 event spinning out of Flashpoint, many readers, reviewers, and fans in general wondered how long it would be before there was yet another reboot. Well apparently it would be over 5 years because, come May, the DC universe will be changing yet again. But by how much? And what’s worth subscribing to?</p>
<div id="attachment_37700" style="width: 980px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37700 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rebirth-Banner.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="545" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rebirth-Banner.jpg 970w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rebirth-Banner-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rebirth-Banner-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rebirth-Banner-298x167.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rebirth-Banner-620x348.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">DC Rebirth One-Shot: On Sale May 25th</p></div>
<p>When DC launched the new 52 ,it was equivalent of a comics based hydrogen bomb. Every single series was thereafter cancelled and 52 new series were launched from #1. Some were met with high praise such as Jeff Lemire’s <em>Animal Man </em>and Geoff John’s run on <em>Aquaman</em>, arguably responsible for making an uncool character cool. Some moves were less well received, such as retconning Barbara Gordon from a wheelchair bound computer genius back to plain old Batgirl. However, despite the backlash from fans and the occasional misstep, such as removing Gail Simon from <em>Batgirl,</em> and turning a contentious, if well received, series into a steaming pile, the New 52 has been a good move for DC. The actual creative merit of the whole initiative is, of course, up for debate, but the fact remains that DC did gain a larger share of the market. When you’re in the business of selling comics, that’s what it’s about.</p>
<p><strong><img class="wp-image-37697 size-full aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/new-52.jpg" alt="new 52" width="1280" height="720" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/new-52.jpg 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/new-52-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/new-52-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/new-52-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/new-52-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/new-52-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></strong></p>
<p>Now here we are with DC Rebirth. An amalgamation, and some may say hodgepodge of the New 52 and pre-New 52 elements, hopefully bringing about the best of both continuities. Most series will be re-launching with a #1 issue, while some will be launching with a ‘Rebirth’ one-shot followed by a regular series. The exception to this are the DC main-stays <em>Action Comics</em> and <em>Detective Comics,</em> which will return to their previous numbering of 957 and 934. If that weren’t enough, some titles will be releasing twice monthly now. Nothing like a hit on the old wallet to kick things off.</p>
<p>So, for the next four weeks, we’ll be looking at all the new series coming out, and looking at the history of their creative teams. We’ll weigh the pros, we’ll weigh the cons, and try to figure out what to throw that hard earned dough down on.</p>
<p>First up this week, the Batman books.</p>

<h1><strong>Batman (Twice Monthly)</strong></h1>
<p><em>Writer: Tom King</em></p>
<p><em>Artist: David Finch</em></p>
<p><em>Rebirth One Shot?: </em>Yes indeed. Tom King pairs with acclaimed former <em>Batman</em> writer Scott Snyder to bring out this one. Snyder’s run is celebrated roundly, so expect good things from this prequel.</p>
<div id="attachment_37676" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-37676" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Batman-Rebirth.jpg" alt="Batman: Rebirth- On Sale June First" width="600" height="923" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Batman-Rebirth.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Batman-Rebirth-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Batman-Rebirth-298x458.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Batman: Rebirth- On Sale June 1st</p></div>
<p><em><br />
The Creative Team:  </em>I get the feeling that after Snyder’s run on <em>Batman</em>, DC aren’t taking any chances with this series. Writer Tom King has only written comics since about 2014, being brought in by DC to co-write the new <em>Grayson </em>series with Tim Seely; wherein Nightwing turns to international espionage. The series was fairly well received, so King was given the opportunity to work on a 12 issue limited run of <em>Omega Men </em>for DC, which was also praised. The hits didn’t stop coming for King as he then turned his attention to a series based on his time in Iraq with <em>Sheriff of Babylon</em> and a series focusing on Marvel’s android, <em>The Vision. </em>Both series were met with critical acclaim; <em>Sheriff of Babylon </em>for its complex characters and plot, and <em>The Vision </em>for being unlike any other superhero comic being published. So in terms of writing, <em>Batman </em>is in incredibly capable hands.</p>
<p>Likewise David Finch is an accomplished artist, having done a large portion of the art on Geoff John’s Justice League crossover, <em>Trinity War</em>. Finch has also provided artwork for several other DC and Marvel series, as well as doing cover artwork for metal band, <em>Disturbed. </em>Crisp line work, well realized characters and a distinctive style, David Finch looks to be a fantastic pairing to an equally fantastic writer.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-37684" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/David-Finch-2-198x300.jpg" alt="David Finch- 2" width="360" height="546" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/David-Finch-2-198x300.jpg 198w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/David-Finch-2-298x452.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/David-Finch-2-620x940.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/David-Finch-2.jpg 736w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" />      <img class="alignnone wp-image-37705" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/David-Finch-4-774x1200.jpg" alt="David Finch- 4" width="349" height="541" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/David-Finch-4-774x1200.jpg 774w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/David-Finch-4-194x300.jpg 194w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/David-Finch-4-768x1191.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/David-Finch-4-298x462.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/David-Finch-4-620x961.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/David-Finch-4.jpg 1032w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" /></p>
<p><em>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </em>For a hero that is so often about the crazy villains, Tom King seems to be going in a slightly different direction with this version of <em>Batman</em>. A new hero rises in Gotham City (calling themselves Gotham). They then promise to save Gotham City from Batman himself. Stories that attempt to place Batman as the villain in the story have been done before, some better than others. So I suppose one’s enthusiasm for the series hinges entirely on if you can stomach Batman sharing Gotham City with another hero. That said, Tom King is a fantastic up and coming writer and has said “The whole theme of this book is using every modern storytelling technique I know to connect with classic Batman stories”. So I’m thinking we can expect some good things from this one.</p>

<h1><strong>Detective Comics (Twice-Monthly)</strong></h1>
<p><em>Writer: James Tynion</em></p>
<p><em>Artist: Eddy Barrows</em></p>
<p><em>Rebirth One Shot?: </em>Nope, <em>Detective Comics is </em>launching straight back into it with #934 and #935 later that month.</p>
<p><em>The Creative Team:</em> <em>Detective Comics</em> is one of DC’s longest and most lucrative properties, so it’ll be interesting to see what direction the series takes after resuming its original numbering. James Tynion is a writer not without some skill. A former student and assistant of Batman veteran Scott Snyder, he cut his teeth on writing back-up stories for <em>Batman </em>during New 52. Shortly afterwards he penned a sell-out title for Boom!, <em>The Woods, </em>which went on to become the highest selling series since <em>Irredeemable</em>. Tynion has also tried his hand at his own Batman stories, becoming one of the head writers for <em>Batman Eternal </em>and the creator of the limited series <em>Batman/TMNT</em>. The inconsistency of <em>Batman Eternal </em>aside (it was, after all, a weekly series for an entire year), <em>Batman/TMNT </em>has been very well received with Tynion commended for understanding what makes Batman great. While he has had some success in the past, this would by Tynion’s first large-scale series by himself. I am hopeful, but he just doesn’t have the same kind of track record and experience of someone like Scott Snyder.</p>
<p>Joining him is Eddy Barrows, a Brazilian artist with work on a variety of DC titles from <em>Green Lantern </em>to a run on <em>Action Comics</em>. Barrows has no experience working with Batman per-se, however he does have experience working on <em>Birds of Prey </em>and <em>Teen Titans</em>. Either way, looking at his work, Barrows is a highly accomplished artist.</p>

<p><em>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?:  </em>I feel like this run of <em>Detective Comics </em>will be popular for two reasons. Firstly, the return to original numbering will attract old fans who objected to the series re-set. Secondly, the series will focus around Batman and Batwoman training Robin, Clayface, Spolier and Cassandra Cain. In the New 52, many fans objected to the removal of both Spoiler and Cassandra Cain as they were seen as positive additions to the Bat-Family. Batwoman’s early exit due to writer/publisher difficulties from the New 52 was equally not well received. So, the return of all three in an ensemble book may prove a great drawcard. Exactly how well Tynion and Barrows will handle the premise remains to be seen, but for fans looking for the return of characters sorely absent from the New 52, <em>Decective Comics </em>may be the way to go.</p>

<h1><strong>Batman Beyond</strong></h1>
<p><em>Writer: Dan Jurgens</em></p>
<p><em>Artist: Bernard Chang</em></p>
<p><em>Rebirth One Shot?: </em>Surely is. Dan Jurgens promises to flip <em>Batman Beyond </em>on its head come the 28<sup>th</sup> of September. (No cover available just yet)</p>
<p><em>The Creative Team: </em>Dan Jurgens is a venerable name at DC Comics, having been a writer on over 30 different series for over 40 years. Jurgens is no stranger to epic stories, having penned not only the continuity changing <em>Zero Hero</em>, but also having a large role in the construction of <em>The Death of Superman</em>. Both stories were met with large praise and incredibly high sales. And yet, I still have some amount of trepidation when it comes to his involvement. The New 52 run of <em>Batman Beyond </em>was also written by Jurgens, which would normally be a good sign. The series started strong and then swiftly went off the rails, with many complaints around the fact that Jurgens seemingly had no idea where he was going. So a great writer with a poor history on this particular title. On the other hand, Bernard Chang has an equally as excellent track record (though not as long) as an artist, having worked on titles from <em>Superman</em> to Valient’s <em>The Second Life of Doctor Mirage</em>. His work on <em>Batman Beyond</em> was also celebrated in the face of Jurgens poor story. Many reviewers felt that Chang’s art suited the tone and setting of the story perfectly, despite the oft-times weak story.</p>

<p><em>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </em>Spinning out of the pages of the initially promising, but ultimately confusing and disappointing <em>New 52: Futures End</em> was at least one ray of light. A new, monthly <em>Batman Beyond </em>series. There was only one, glaring problem with it; there was no Terry McGinnis. Terry McGinnis was long the man behind the mask in <em>Batman Beyond, </em>and his death in <em>Futures End</em> and replacement by Tim Drake was seen as something of a poor move. This new <em>Batman Beyond</em> promises (somehow) a return to Terry McGinnis, with the first arc of the series concerned with who is behind the mask. For fans of <em>Batman Beyond,</em> this may be a reason to place an order, but for me Dan Jurgens poor track record on the series is reason enough to stay away.</p>

<h1><strong>All-Star Batman (Twice Monthly)</strong></h1>
<p><em>Writer: Scott Snyder</em></p>
<p><em>Artist: Varied</em></p>
<p><em>Rebirth One Shot?: </em>No way, this is all new stuff, no rebirth needed.</p>
<p><em>The Creative Team: </em>This is a bit of an odd one. Not in terms of the writerm so we’ll start with that first. Scott Snyder, as I have mentioned previously, was the New 52 writer on <em>Batman</em>. Unlike many other writers for the New 52, Snyder wasn’t replaced half way through the run. Snyder was very good. His run on <em>Batman</em> is considered to be one of the best in a very long time, with the first trade paperback of his run, <em>The Court of Owls </em>hitting the top spot on the New York Times graphic novel bestseller list. Prior to that, Snyder wrote for <em>Detective Comics</em> in a run that was also highly successful. Snyder kicked off his career for DC writing <em>American Vampire</em> for Vertigo. The series was a huge success, winning the Eisner Award for best new series. So, it’s fairly safe to say that in terms of writing, <em>All-Star Batman </em>can expect exciting, fresh stories that are decently written.</p>
<p>It’s in terms of art that things are a bit odd. Snyder’s plan is to have a series of different artists come in and illustrate different story arcs. So really, there’s no way to tell what sort of quality we could be in for. However, the first artist on the line-up is John Romita Jr., who is regarded as one of the best artist DC has right now, having brought him over from Marvel after a 30 year career. Romita was one of Marvel’s best artists with a stellar run on <em>Daredevil </em>and doing the art for Mark Millar’s <em>Kick Ass</em>. With Snyder and Romita on the first arc, <em>All-Star Batman </em>is set to be in great hands, to begin with at least.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-37693" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/John-Romita-2.jpeg" alt="John Romita- 2" width="360" height="566" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/John-Romita-2.jpeg 578w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/John-Romita-2-191x300.jpeg 191w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/John-Romita-2-298x468.jpeg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" />       <img class="alignnone wp-image-37695" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Marcus-To-1.jpg" alt="Marcus To- 1" width="360" height="520" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Marcus-To-1.jpg 485w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Marcus-To-1-208x300.jpg 208w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Marcus-To-1-298x430.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></p>
<p><em>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </em>After having written Batman stories for over five years, Snyder has said that he (somehow) still has Batman stories to tell. <em>All-Star Batman</em> is slated to be a kind of anthology of stories written by Snyder and drawn by different artists. The actual content of the stories is unclear, with some sources saying they’ll be unconnected, and others saying it’s all part of a large, epic Bat-story that Snyder has planned. With at least five different artists lined up for the series already and whispers of a large story, I can’t help but have flashbacks to <em>Batman Eternal </em>which promised similar things and ultimately felt a bit average. That said, Snyder is an incredibly capable writer and, with a monthly release instead of a weekly release, perhaps this series will indeed be All-Star.</p>

<h1><strong>Batgirl and The Birds of Prey</strong></h1>
<p><em>Writer: </em>Julie and Shawna Benson</p>
<p><em>Artist: </em>Claire Roe</p>
<p><em>Rebirth One Shot?: </em>Yes, details (and a cover) are scare right now, but you can expect it July 20<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p><em>The Creative Team: </em>Back in the days of yore, when I was just a lad, Gaile Simone was the writer for <em>Birds of Prey.</em> Barbara Gordon was Oracle and a bag of lollies was 50 cents. Gail Simone’s run on <em>Birds of Prey,</em> and the treatment of a wheelchair bound Barbara Gordon, was phenomenal. The writing was good, the art was good; it was a damn good series. Why do I mention this here? Because Julie and Shawna Benson have some huge shoes to fill. I have scoured the internet and, as best I can tell, this will be their first comic book series ever. They’re not without experience as both have spent time as writing assistants on CW’s <em>The 100, </em> Julie Benson scripting one episode herself. As near as I can the tell, the duo have only really worked on <em>The 100</em> and, having never watched the show, I can’t honestly tell what they’ll be like.</p>
<p>Claire Roe, on the other hand, I’m feeling more confident about. Like the Benson’s, she is inexperienced. Roe has only ever worked professionally on the Scottish series <em>Saltire</em> since 2013. However, <em>Saltire </em>has been received immensely well with particular praise heaped upon Roe’s vivid artwork and style. Looking at Roe’s work, it is comforting to see that <em>Batgirl and The Birds of Prey </em>will decidedly not be plagued the usual anatomical problems that many all-woman comics are.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-37682" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-3-212x300.jpg" alt="Claire Roe- 3" width="361" height="511" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-3-212x300.jpg 212w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-3-768x1086.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-3-849x1200.jpg 849w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-3-298x421.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-3-620x877.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-3.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" />      <img class="alignnone wp-image-37681" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-2-216x300.jpg" alt="Claire Roe- 2" width="368" height="511" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-2-216x300.jpg 216w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-2-768x1069.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-2-862x1200.jpg 862w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-2-298x415.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-2-620x863.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claire-Roe-2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /></p>
<p><em>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </em>In the New 52, the <em>Birds of Prey</em> series was, to be kind, misguided. It lost the relationships, humor, and clever story-lines that made the series great. It also had no Barbara Gordon. DC, somehow confident that Huntress and Black Canary alone were the Birds of Prey. This version sees the trio reunited and leading the charge against a new villain that attempts to impersonate Oracle; something Barbara Gordon (now Batgirl) is dead set against. While the thought of the ‘original’ Birds of Prey team being together again is tempting, the unknown writers does me give pause. If I were already a fan of <em>Birds of Prey</em>, or Batgirl as a character, I may be tempted.</p>

<h1><strong>Nightwing (Twice Monthly)</strong></h1>
<p><em>Writer: </em>Tim Seely</p>
<p><em>Artist: </em>Javi Fernandez and Marcus To</p>
<p><em>Rebirth One Shot?: </em>Surely is, with Tim Drake back as Nightwing (in the blue suit and all) after stint as a spy, Tim Seely’ll have to do some serious juggling.</p>
<div id="attachment_37699" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37699 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Nightwing-Rebirth.jpg" alt="Nightwing Rebirth" width="600" height="910" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Nightwing-Rebirth.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Nightwing-Rebirth-198x300.jpg 198w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Nightwing-Rebirth-298x452.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Nightwing: Rebirth- On Sale July 13</p></div>
<p><em>The Creative Team: </em>Tim Seely is the obvious choice to write <em>Nightwing</em>. After all, he was the original writer for <em>Grayson</em>, the series that’s preceding <em>Nightwing</em>. While Seely was criticised for aspects of the story beyond his control (more on that in just a second), the series was praised for being, overall, pretty good. Many critics agreed that <em>Grayson </em>was a rollicking spy adventure that, as time went on and Seely’s personal stlye came to the fore, became steadily weirder. Seely has also written several volumes of <em>Lovebunny and Mr Hell </em>and several volumes of <em>Hack/Slash</em>, both of which have been received well and remarked on for their strangeness and quality of writing.</p>
<p>On the art side, Javi Fernandez is yet to have a series to call his own, with several assisting roles or one-off issues over a variety of series. However, he did do the art for Kickstart Comics’s <em>The Book of Lilah, </em>which was recognized as a very good looking comic, even if it didn’t gain incredible popularity. Joining him is Marcus To, an artist with DC comics for several years, most well known for his work on <em>Red Robin</em>. Both artists seem to bring different styles with To the more realistic and precise of the two, while Fernandez looks set to provide a slightly more fantastical flair. With Seely providing the direction, this may be a creative team to watch.</p>

<p><em>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </em>Right off the bat, Tim Seely is in a good place. While <em>Grayson </em>was well received, it was initially criticized for having changed the character of Nightwing from a roof-jumping superhero to a train jumping spy. Many fans felt this was against the character, but <em>Nightwing </em>looks set to fix that with the classic Nightwing look returning. <em>Nightwing</em> kicks off at the end of <em>Grayson, </em>with Dick Drayson now firmly back in the spandex, leading the Titans and set to topple an international conspiracy. With a creative team that looks to be firm, fans of Bat-adventures with a slightly different flavor may want to give this one a look.</p>

<p><em>The Creative Team: Batgirl </em>is a series that seems to go through writers. After an incredibly strong start in the New 52 by Gail Simone, the team was switched to Cameron Stewart and Brendan Fletcher. Now for Rebirth, Hope Larson is being brought in to write this continuation of Stewart and Fletcher’s run. No real surprise as Stewart and Fletcher’s run was roundly criticized for turning <em>Batgirl </em>into a tween book in stark contrast to Simone’s more serious beginning. But I digress. It would seem that <em>Batgirl </em>is now in capable, if mildly inexperienced hands in the form of Hope Larson. Larson has never written for DC or Marvel, however she has achieved some recognition through self-published comics, and even won the Eisner Award for Special Recognition in 2007. I have tried to read some of her free stuff, but all the links are dead, so hey, what’re you gonna do? All indicators point to a capable writer ready to make her mark.</p>
<p>Rafael Albuquerque however brings well over 10 years’ experience drawing and illustrating comic books, most notably his work on <em>Blue Beetle </em>for over two years and his part in co-creating <em>American Vampire </em>with Scott Snyder. With a distinctive style and a real art to his work, the team for the new <em>Batgirl </em>is looking good.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-37720" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rafael-1-193x300.jpg" alt="Rafael 1" width="360" height="560" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rafael-1-193x300.jpg 193w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rafael-1-768x1195.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rafael-1.jpg 771w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rafael-1-298x464.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rafael-1-620x965.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" />       <img class="alignnone wp-image-37721" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rafael-2-198x300.jpg" alt="Rafael 2" width="360" height="547" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rafael-2-198x300.jpg 198w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rafael-2-298x452.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rafael-2.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></p>
<p><em>What’s It About, and Is It Worth It?: </em>After the conclusion of Stewart and Fletcher’s run, Barbara Gordon is setting out to find herself the only way a twenty-something superhero can; an O.E around the world. The team, at least in terms of writing, is inexperienced but promising. The art is set to be top shelf stuff and there’s nothing to suggest the writing won’t match. So if the idea of a jet-setting, crime fighting Batgirl with a healthy dose of introspection appeals to you, dig right in.</p>
<p><strong><u>What I’ll Be Taking Away</u></strong></p>
<p>I’ll be frank, I’m not a giant Batman fan. I like Batman, but I’ve just never really felt compelled to grab a run of <em>Detective Comics</em> or anything. I will now be breaking that rule. With Tom King’s history, I feel I’d be mad to not start picking up <em>Batman</em>, even if it’s just to see what such a great writer does with such a great character. If I had the money I’d also grab <em>All-Star Batman</em> and possibly <em>Batgirl</em>, just to see how they turn out. But alas, as you’ll see in the coming weeks, there are many, many other series I’ll grabbing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello! I’m back, once again, to give you my first impressions on an Anime that Transformation Sequence likely won’t have time to cover in full. As a reminder, what I consider a first impression of a show is watching the first three episodes. This gives the show time to introduce the world, the characters, the driving plot, and the antagonists. This week, I want to talk about <em>Tonkatsu DJ Agetaro.</em></p>
<div class="video"><iframe width="620" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-icPjhPYck?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><em>Tonkatsu DJ Agetaro</em> follows the life of a young man named Agetaro, who lives in Japan with his family at their tonkatsu shop. He lives a rather lazy life with little motivation to do much of anything. After a fateful night of delivering a bento box to a club owner in Shibuya, Agetaro is introduced to &#8216;club life.&#8217; In the club, he hears the best DJ in the world start spinning records and is inspired to not only be a DJ, but the best tonkatsu chef as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37841" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-4.png" alt="tonk dj 4" width="956" height="536" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-4.png 956w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-4-300x168.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-4-768x431.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-4-298x167.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-4-620x348.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px" /></p>
<p>The first thing you will notice about this show is it&#8217;s art style. It&#8217;s a kind of controlled sloppiness that I actually appreciate. It&#8217;s nice to see some hand drawn shows take some risks, even though I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s computer assisted in some way. Some people might find how jittery the animation is to be a turn off, but I thought it injected the show with that much more personality, and even more so, reflected the tone. Each character has a unique design that is cool without being so over the top, like a lot of anime&#8217;s tend to go for.</p>
<div id="attachment_37842" style="width: 964px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37842 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-2.png" alt="tonk dj 2" width="954" height="536" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-2.png 954w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-2-300x169.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-2-768x431.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-2-298x167.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-2-620x348.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yes. Enjoy My Yum Yums.</p></div>
<p>The two real stand outs on the show though are the humor and the music. This show is hysterical and cute. Agetaro is a teenager so everything he discovers and tries is the biggest deal to him, and it made me laugh every time he tried something new or had a new experience play out for him. The supporting cast is great too. They add to the humor and carve their own place in the story without detracting from Agetaro too much. Something else I appreciated about the supporting characters is that no one tell Agetaro he can&#8217;t accomplish his goals. They may give him a hard time for being a dork, but they never tell him to not follow his dreams.</p>
<div id="attachment_37843" style="width: 964px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37843 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-3.png" alt="tonk dj 3" width="954" height="530" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-3.png 954w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-3-300x167.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-3-768x427.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-3-298x166.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-3-620x344.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">And the club is Jumpin&#8217;, Jumpin&#8217;</p></div>
<p>On to the music. For a show about becoming a DJ, I had high hopes for the tunes, and they did not disappoint. While I don&#8217;t recognize any of the tracks they use, I was getting serious <em>Jet Set Radio </em>vibes and that is for the best. It strikes a good balance of being able to be danced to, while also allowing for you to just sit back, chill, and enjoy the sounds. I hope they release a soundtrack at some point for this show because it would be quite choice.</p>
<div id="attachment_37845" style="width: 966px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37845 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-1.png" alt="tonk dj 1" width="956" height="535" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-1.png 956w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-1-300x168.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-1-768x430.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-1-298x167.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tonk-dj-1-620x347.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Too Good for this Earth</p></div>
<p>Overall, I would say absolutely give <em>Tonkatsu DJ Agetaro</em> a chance! Between it&#8217;s unique art style, sense of humor, and bumping tunes, you have on your hands a real winner. Also, each episode is only 9 minutes long, so even if you somehow don&#8217;t like the show, you won&#8217;t have wasted too much of your time. Thanks for reading, now, if you will excuse me, I must find the nearest place that serves tonkatsu.</p>

<p>Holy crap! What an amazing issue! Who doesn’t like a good prison break story? Before we get to that, let’s take a moment to remember how we got there. Noreen initiated her plan to smuggle<img class=" wp-image-37818 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/images-1-300x118.jpg" alt="http://cdn.bleedingcool.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-27-at-1.14.23-PM.png" width="287" height="113" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/images-1-300x118.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/images-1-298x118.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/images-1.jpg 357w" sizes="(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px" /> Hazel out of the prison. Concurrently, Marko, Alana, and Prince Robot IV initiate their own plan to break Hazel out. We meet Lying Cat’s sibling, which is not 100% relevant but still worth mentioning. Meanwhile, the Will lands on Quietus and begins to accost Squire, Prince Robot’s son. In the last panel we see cute, lovable Ghüs reveal he is also quite the bad ass.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-37822 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tumblr_o5sg153F7L1r7hjkqo1_500-195x300.jpg" alt="https://40.media.tumblr.com/100b5a75cb32db74cd8adb4fef4711cf/tumblr_o5sg153F7L1r7hjkqo1_500.jpg" width="195" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tumblr_o5sg153F7L1r7hjkqo1_500-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tumblr_o5sg153F7L1r7hjkqo1_500-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tumblr_o5sg153F7L1r7hjkqo1_500.jpg 488w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px" />Thankfully, unlike most media these days, Issue 36 wraps up most of the story lines by the end of the issue. There is still a BIG reveal at the end, like HUGE. When I got to that part I screamed out, “Holy shit!” dropped the comic, and then repeated myself about 4 times. My neighbors must think I am crazy. I pride myself on being able to guess the ending of most TV shows and books. For this issue, I didn’t even have a chance. I never imagined it would end this way. I can’t really get into this issue too much, it is ripe with spoilers. I will say there is no Lying Cat, or even her siblings! We do get a true conclusion to this arc, which is greatly appreciated. Saga usually ends on a cliffhanger, Hell just about every form of media now does thanks to shows like LOST. It would be easy, even expected of Vaughan to follow suit. God bless that man, he tied up all the loose ends and I am still hungry for more. I truly have no idea where things will go from here.</p>
<p>Sadly, we will have months to wonder. Issue 36 is the last in this story arc, meaning we will have to wait about four months before issue 37 is released. There is one positive note, this entire arc will be released in trade paperback on 6/29/16 and it is only $12.00. Now is a great time to get into the single greatest comic series ever created. Of course, this issue is great too. We get another <img class=" wp-image-37815 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-27-at-1.22.42-PM-300x159.png" alt="http://cdn.bleedingcool.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-27-at-1.22.42-PM.png" width="290" height="153" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-27-at-1.22.42-PM-300x159.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-27-at-1.22.42-PM-768x406.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-27-at-1.22.42-PM-298x158.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-27-at-1.22.42-PM-620x328.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-27-at-1.22.42-PM.png 938w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" />gorgeous cover. Is it just me or does Sweet Boy look like he’s flying? That wave though, simply breathtaking! If you don’t get this issue, you will also miss out on the finalists for the Saga Costume contest. There are about 10 photos in the back of the issue and they are great! I don’t even know if I could pick a favorite, there are so many spot on cosplays. Buy this issue, I doubt these brilliant costumes will make it into the trade paperback. You won’t regret it, this issue was so good and this arc was perfect. I can’t wait for issue 37 but I don’t really have a choice! Feel free to leave a comment below or hit me up on twitter if you want to discuss this issue or this arc, I would love to hear from you. If not, see you in 4 terrible months!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Continuing along the path that her first book, <em>The Fire Sermon</em>, laid out, <em>Map of Bones </em>is another measured elegy for a world in ruins. Atomic detonations blanketed the world in cold and ignorance, and the survivors learned to fear anything to do with the blasts. Technology. The past. Each other.</p>
<p>A quirk of the poisoned world has made all children twins, fraternal twins, with one perfectly normal and the other bearing some deformity of body or mind. The perfect children, Alphas, are kept by parents. The imperfect children, Omegas, are branded and banished to communities on the outskirts, cared for by the previous generation of Omegas, since all Omegas are sterile. The Alphas hate and fear their twins, but are unable to destroy them, since the death of your twin means your own death as well. No matter how far apart, no matter how different in station, no matter how healthy one twin is, one twin&#8217;s death is both twins&#8217; fate.</p>
<p>Cassandra is the Omega twin, but for years she was able to hide in plain sight. She, like her Alpha twin Zach, looked entirely whole. But inside her head, visions tormented her. She is a seer, a rare Omega with the deformity of psychic powers, destined to go mad. Zach despised her ability to pass, which made both their childhoods uncertain and fraught, and once free of her he embarked on a quest to change the fate of all Omegas. He became the Reformer, a Council member who re-started the machines and began &#8220;tanking&#8221; Omegas, putting them in stasis so that their Alpha twins could enjoy uninterrupted lives. Cass is determined to stop him from putting Omegas into those lifeless purgatories, but she doesn&#8217;t know how.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-37439" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cover.jpg" alt="cover" width="351" height="565" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cover.jpg 640w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cover-186x300.jpg 186w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cover-298x480.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cover-620x998.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /></p>
<p>This is not your typical post-apocalyptic fare, with pretty teens making grand gestures to their love interests as well as to the new world order. If I sound snide, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m awfully tired of dystopia, not because I hate all of it. I certainly don&#8217;t hate this. But it is tiring, in the same way that Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s <em>The Road </em>was tiring: its only optimism is survival. There are no daring rescues, no inciting speeches. People break and die so easily, and courage is measured not by gesture, but by endurance.</p>
<p>Cass has endured long, starting from the time when she was betrayed by her twin and imprisoned until now, fleeing in the wake of the destruction of the Omega rebellion and the death of her lover Kip. But she will have to endure yet more: death and battle and privation, and her constant, creeping madness besides. All of this in search of the Ark, a mythic place where survivors of the blast waited out the radiation, rather than endured it. She has no idea what the Ark might tell them, or whether it will lead them to Elsewhere, which is another bare-bones myth. It&#8217;s a place where Omegas can be free of oppression. It has no known direction, no features, and no stories.</p>
<p>The ways in which the bomb(s) stripped away particularity and reduced cultures, religions, and histories to Alpha and Omega, Either/Or, Have/Not is a striking insight. More than anything else it speaks to the exhaustion of the characters and humanity as a whole. We would expect endless embellishment on a place like Elsewhere&#8211;its gods, its bounty, its beauty&#8211;yet everyone deals in its practicalities. Even bards sing of reality and more reality. It&#8217;s as if the fire was hot enough to burn the magic right out of us.</p>
<p>This is why Cass finds it so difficult to advance her philosophy of Alpha-Omega equality: no one has time for fairy-tales (another word for ideals). Cass is a highly moral voice, almost painfully principled, advocating against torture and appeasement at every turn. She firmly believes in the equality of Alphas and Omegas, a stance arising from her unusual childhood spent being treated as a potential Alpha. It&#8217;s hard for her to make her voice heard, though, since Alphas and Omegas have been segregated and taught to fear one another since birth. The metaphor for any this-worldly instance of discrimination is clear: any Other is quite literally your sibling, and your survival is literally tied to theirs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a heavy lesson, and not one that&#8217;s easy to read in this story&#8217;s blasted, desolate context. But it&#8217;s still and important and well-written one, and one worth reading to the honestly quite shocking twist at the end. Ah, the ending. It&#8217;s a cool, bright light after all the fire and gloom, and there&#8217;s such a pure pleasure upon reaching it. It really is beautiful. But you have to earn that ending—you, too, have to endure—to see what comes after the blast.</p>

<p>PAX East 2016 has come and gone, and just like every other year time flew right before my eyes. Each of the three days at the convention center felt like a whirlwind of delightful experiences, but I was not able to play everything that I wanted. I don&#8217;t think even a week-long PAX would allow for that&#8230;but I did want to mention some of the most enjoyable, unique or just plain exciting things that I saw on the show floor. These are not the &#8220;best games of the show&#8221; but rather experiences that stuck with me longer than sleep deprivation/hangover.</p>
<p>Game of the Show &#8211; <a href="http://www.marblesthebrainstore.com/klask.htm">Klask</a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37790" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/getDynamicImage.jpg" alt="getDynamicImage" width="800" height="450" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/getDynamicImage.jpg 800w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/getDynamicImage-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/getDynamicImage-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/getDynamicImage-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/getDynamicImage-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Ok, I am giving away one &#8220;Best of Show&#8221; award since <em>Klask</em> took the Geeklies by storm. The tabletop area of PAX East is smaller, quieter but still uniquely overwhelming. Sure, there weren&#8217;t giant dinosaurs in the tabletop area, but there were still several games that stood out. <em>Klask</em> is like air hockey but with magnets and is the size of a tray table. The goal is to hit the ball into your opponent&#8217;s goal while avoiding three white magnets and losing your playing piece to your own goal. When we first saw it we had a strong &#8220;This is weird and I must play it&#8221; urge. After playing <em>Klask</em> we returned whenever we had a spare couple of minutes. That is because you control your game piece with a magnet that is underneath the gameboard. It looks really weird. Here, just watch Nick and I play in <a href="https://youtu.be/S4JGK7HfV1M">this poorly made video</a>. Nick gets Klasked pretty hard (the publisher has a much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VB68KfqO5o&amp;ab_channel=MarblesTheBrainStore">better video</a> that explains how it works). Balancing all of the moving parts of <em>Klask</em> was a &#8220;blask&#8221; each time I played. I would avoid the white magnets in the middle only to have Nick hit them all on my side. Each and every game stressed me out and every point brought a sigh of relief.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kasedogames.com/#!themetronomicon/oko55">Metronomicon </a>(Best game I didn&#8217;t play but did stop me in my tracks)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37791" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TheMetronomicon_Logo-small.jpg" alt="TheMetronomicon_Logo-small" width="3960" height="2228" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TheMetronomicon_Logo-small.jpg 3960w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TheMetronomicon_Logo-small-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TheMetronomicon_Logo-small-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TheMetronomicon_Logo-small-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TheMetronomicon_Logo-small-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TheMetronomicon_Logo-small-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 3960px) 100vw, 3960px" /></p>
<p>While Jennifer and Nika were chatting with a group of designers I went and explored a bit. While idly looking at all the games being played I got to <em>The Metronomicon</em> and just stopped. One of the best parts of PAX is seeing games that make you say &#8220;why are there not dozens of games like this?&#8221; since some games just make so much sense. <em>The Metronomicon</em> is a rhythm dancing game RPG. Basically, take <em>Rock Band</em> but make it all about an adventure party that is trying to kill monsters instead of become obscenely rich. Your successful button presses charge up your heroes&#8217; skills, which you use to cast a wide variety of fantasy style spells and attacks. After chatting with the fine folks at Puuba I knew that <em>The Metronomicon</em> was a must play once it was released so I decided to mosey on to the next exciting thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecovegames.com/">The Depths of Durangrar</a> &#8211; Somehow the &#8220;Most&#8221; Unique</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37792" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hero_Shot_6-1.jpg" alt="Hero_Shot_6 (1)" width="1600" height="900" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hero_Shot_6-1.jpg 1600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hero_Shot_6-1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hero_Shot_6-1-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hero_Shot_6-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hero_Shot_6-1-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hero_Shot_6-1-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p>In a listicle filled with a variety of unique games, <em>The Depths of Durangrar</em> from Creative Cove Games is somehow the &#8220;most&#8221; unique thing that I saw. Situated at the edge of the Indie Magabooth&#8217;s Tabletop section was&#8230; a tent or maybe some sort of yurt. Maybe it was an old timey photo booth, I had no idea. All I saw was black canvas and shoes poking out of the bottom so I knew that I had to try it out. Inside we found darkness and <em>The Depths of Durangrar.</em> I don&#8217;t think grammar allows for something to be &#8220;most&#8221; unique but if it did <em>The Depths of Durangrar </em>would<em> </em>qualify. Inside our darkened gaming den we found a somewhat straightforward dungeon crawling board game, except we couldn&#8217;t see the board. Meant to be played in teams, the adventurers must try to use their lamps, tiny directional LEDs set within the game pieces, to explore the dungeon while avoiding the terrible monster. It is hard to describe, so here, look:</p>
<p><img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&amp;ik=b7b62bc4c9&amp;view=fimg&amp;th=1542a8970e7713a1&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=emb&amp;realattid=ii_1542a7679cda5229&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ91SWUI12PVODPLY-RFJ9gha4mJ4AfJd34633beoO0H3yuGjPxcldBgvOz-VixT2rnmMBOzedx76E3yWmxcXXYSinfh1R3bI4Efbj1_gIwLXfHCHdXGpogQG-U&amp;sz=w1088-h548&amp;ats=1461787983535&amp;rm=1542a8970e7713a1&amp;zw&amp;atsh=1" alt="Inline image 2" /></p>
<p>Cool, huh? The monster player doesn&#8217;t have an LED light to see the board, no, they have honest to goodness night-vision goggles. Each adventurer must use their limited action pool to move and loot while avoiding the monster and traps built within the dungeon itself. Again, all in the dark. It was really rad and weirdly spooky.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.laywastegames.com/#home-1-section">Dragoon</a> &#8211; I Didn&#8217;t Get a Chance to Play This and I am Still Mad</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37793" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dragoon-small.png" alt="Dragoon-small" width="890" height="559" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dragoon-small.png 890w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dragoon-small-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dragoon-small-768x482.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dragoon-small-298x187.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dragoon-small-620x389.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px" /></p>
<p>I know almost nothing about <em>Dragoon </em>but there was definite buzz surrounding the game on the show-floor among the tabletop folks that I know. Plus, it reeks style. My understanding is that you play as a dragon and you do dragon type things, but I missed out on doing those dragon things since there were always folks playing <em>Dragoon</em>. I maybe could have tried muscling my way in but I had a feeling I would be seeing this game again (my friend bought it).</p>
<p>Well, these are the games from PAX East 2016 that I think you really should know about. There were so many more that I could have included and it breaks my heart, but it just goes to show how much fun can be had at your local PAX. I will definitely be reaching out to many of the fine developers that I missed, so hopefully I can bring more PAX East goodness for all of 2016.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Living Campaign is a series of articles where every author has an impact on the world. Articles can focus on any part of the setting, from locations to NPCs or even events. Writers can add new elements to the world or they can build upon what already has been defined. This will be a system-agnostic series, meaning that it will provide flavor and content instead of stat blocks and monster entries.</p>
<p>The intent of this series is to provide inspiration for home games. It will draw on foundational elements from Lovecraftian fiction as well as the horror and urban fantasy genres. The ideas presented can be utilized individually, or as a whole. As the setting develops and evolves, special articles will feature story lines within the established world. But all of the content in this series is simply fodder for additional development.</p>
<p>The specific boundaries and details of this campaign setting are intentionally vague. This is done so that all contributors have absolute freedom to create whatever they wish. Authors can add in any geographic details they want, from coastlines to mountains. The city itself might contain a university, manufacturing plants, shipping docks, or any number of physical locations. The general location and time frame will be the United States in the 1920s. However, the nature of this genre lends itself to a certain flexibility. Anything can, and might, happen.</p>
<p>And with the introduction complete…welcome to New Coventry.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Hope Housing: Location</span></p>
<p>New Hope Housing is a small housing complex located in the downtown area of New Coventry. It&#8217;s a small cluster of buildings with converted studio style apartments and some duplexes for larger families. The kind of people who live in the complex are people who are in need. This could be anyone from people on some sort of assisted living, widows, veterans just coming home from battle, or some people just down on their luck. The general vibe from the area is that New Coventry does everything in its power to help its residents, most of which are grateful.</p>
<p>The apartments are all very cookie cutter in design. Each one comes equipped with a small closet, bathroom, a galley style kitchen, and just enough living space available to fit a double bed, and some other small pieces of furniture depending on the occupant. An example of one of the residents of the New Hope Housing complex is our very own Anna Ripley. Her apartment has all the standard goods along with a desk and type writer for when she wants to work late. The duplexes themselves are not ideal but the best Coventry could do. They&#8217;re two bedroom homes, with a bathroom, galley kitchen, and enough living space to fit larger families if needed.</p>
<p>The overall goal of the complex is to help those in need in anyway possible. This could be aiding some residents in finding jobs, classes to help with money, and the like. The complex itself might not be somewhere people end up but it&#8217;s a decent place to live given most of the residents situation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Someone get ready to play some <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Europe</span>. The spring season is almost over.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blindspot &#8211; One Begets Technique<img class="size-medium wp-image-37748 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a-dubious-order-blindspot-300x200.jpg" alt="a-dubious-order-blindspot" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a-dubious-order-blindspot-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a-dubious-order-blindspot-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a-dubious-order-blindspot.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
I have no idea why the writers decided to follow last week&#8217;s solid episode with this tragedy of a heist escapade. Not only was everything stupidly predictable, but it had nothing to do with tattoos or the actual plot. In general, <em>Blindspot</em> benefits greatly when the plot isn&#8217;t always the focus, mostly because its stretched pretty thin by this point. However, an episode like this, so late in the season does not work, especially when there&#8217;s no precedent for it happening before. Every show has its low spot, and this was <em>Blindspot&#8217;s</em>. The setup was silly and pointless. There were quite a few plot holes. What kind of master thief doesn&#8217;t have a video surveillance in his insanely protected house? Come on. And every &#8220;surprise reveal&#8221; could be seen a mile away by any viewer who&#8217;s ever seen any movie about any criminal shenanigans ever. The action was disappointing. This entire episode painted the FBI team that&#8217;s been established as the best at solving problems by connecting the dots with extremely difficult to solve puzzles as not able to out-think a goofball who can&#8217;t take a breath without making a bad joke. Maybe the team can only function if a tattoo is helping them out. I&#8217;m disappointed in this episode. I&#8217;ve come to expect more from this show.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-37749 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Lucifer-112_SCN8_0269_f_hires2-750x334-300x134.jpg" alt="Lucifer-112_SCN8_0269_f_hires2-750x334" width="300" height="134" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Lucifer-112_SCN8_0269_f_hires2-750x334-300x134.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Lucifer-112_SCN8_0269_f_hires2-750x334-298x133.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Lucifer-112_SCN8_0269_f_hires2-750x334-620x276.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Lucifer-112_SCN8_0269_f_hires2-750x334.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Lucifer &#8211; #TeamLucifer</strong></span><br />
You don&#8217;t know how much it pains me to write that hashtag. Well, I can try to explain. Slightly less than watching this episode. These writers just have no idea how to do anything. They exploit stereotypes while using the same stereotypes to drive the plot. The detectives can&#8217;t tell when a letter is clearly upside down. And apparently, a professional detective can go from making an accusation based on wearing male fashion accessories to not understating a connection based on the same male fashion accessories. The episode casually drops the knowledge that angels can hurt each other, along with nifty hell-forged weapons. That&#8217;s something that would&#8217;ve logically come up earlier. It also turned a potentially interesting character and plot device into an insane killer. This episode also reinforces the idea that Lucifer in his divine role is tasked with punishing the guilty, which while it is the social norm, is not correct according to the mythology. The only interesting part of this episode was the quick exchange during the brotherly brawl about the rationalization of actions. But of course, the show couldn&#8217;t handle anything like an intriguing exploration of philosophy, so it dropped it instantly. The episode also took the mystery of Decker to a stupid level by establishing an aura around her that effects Lucifer It&#8217;s a silly punchline instead of a plot development. The twist ending is clearly supposed to amp up the excitement going into the last episode of the season, but it fell short. This was another bad episode in a bad season of a bad show.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gotham &#8211; Pinewood<img class="size-medium wp-image-37750 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gotham-strange-video-pinewood-300x203.jpg" alt="gotham-strange-video-pinewood" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gotham-strange-video-pinewood-300x203.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gotham-strange-video-pinewood-298x201.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gotham-strange-video-pinewood-620x419.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gotham-strange-video-pinewood.jpg 622w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
This episode starts with reminding viewers that Gordon won&#8217;t return to his job as a police officer because he has to solve a crime. Which is something police officers do. He then follows that up with threatening to murder his defenseless, traumatized, and probably still insane ex fiance. But hey, that&#8217;s totally cool because Gordon is a hero doing the right thing. I did enjoy Bullock&#8217;s whammie drawer. I did not enjoy Gordon&#8217;s rampage montage, mostly because it was boring. Everything else in the episode was a a tragedy of mixed messages. Bruce breaks into a house after saying picking a lock is a morally neutral. Gordon talks about doing what&#8217;s right and then talks about interrogation via death threats. Characters refuse to explain anything, then delve into nothing but exposition. Oh, and of course Barb is still a loony killer. Because no-one ever saw that coming and it&#8217;s a huge surprise. Oh wait, she isn&#8217;t! Whoever wrote this rubbish has no idea what makes a good story. Constantly twisting plot elements is not a way to make a story interesting. It&#8217;s just lazy. And then there was the typical &#8220;nothing makes sense&#8221; elements. The super modern computer. The entire jail break scene, including throwing a grenade like a Frisbee. A Freeze suit with no helmet (not because it&#8217;s not like the actual character, but because a suit with no helmet means that all the cold air or whatever instantly escapes and doesn&#8217;t help). Oh, and I don&#8217;t even want to talk about how Professor Chin Beard brought a dude back to life and ruined one of the coolest characters from the comic books. However. I am pleasantly surprised that <em>Gotham</em> is actually succeeding at building a foundation for its story. It&#8217;s unfortunate that it&#8217;s taken 2 seasons to get there, but at least there&#8217;s now something linking all these events beyond &#8220;we are telling a weird version of the Batman story&#8221;. The elements of this story started back in season one, but I honestly think that the writers forgot about it until now. There is still nothing good about <em>Gotham</em>, but at least it h as some sense of direction now.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-37751 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/the-flash-season-2-versus-zoom-image-6-300x213.jpg" alt="the-flash-season-2-versus-zoom-image-6" width="300" height="213" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/the-flash-season-2-versus-zoom-image-6-300x213.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/the-flash-season-2-versus-zoom-image-6-768x544.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/the-flash-season-2-versus-zoom-image-6-298x211.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/the-flash-season-2-versus-zoom-image-6-620x439.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/the-flash-season-2-versus-zoom-image-6.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The Flash &#8211; Versus Zoom</strong></span></p>
<div>
<p>I&#8217;m so glad <em>Flash</em> is back. I missed it. The origin and explanation of Zoom was interesting, if predictable. Not predictable from what happened in the show, but predictable in the sense of it&#8217;s a typical super villain origin story. And while it was nice to get some understanding of the character, it also weakened his motivation. He&#8217;s not a criminal mastermind and he doesn&#8217;t have a larger scheme. He&#8217;s just a crazy killer who wants power. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. It works perfectly in the comic book genre. But I think a better payoff to the Zoom arc would&#8217;ve been a villain with more complex motivation. The other events in this episode were very typical for Flash. There was some drama, some jokes, and some really stupid decisions. Luckily, Flash can pull this off without being a bore. Of course it was obvious to viewers that the team&#8217;s plan to get Zoom would backfire. That&#8217;s what makes it work. Comic book plot lines are always obvious. <em>Flash</em> makes this entertaining because of the strong foundation of characters it established early on. I am more willing to forgive the predictable and obvious in <em>Flash</em> because the characters are engaging and they&#8217;ve gotten me invested in what happens to them. This episode also delivered a great cliffhanger. I wouldn&#8217;t call it a shocking twist, but it still was successful and getting me excited for what comes next.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Legends of Tomorrow &#8211; Last Refuge<img class="size-medium wp-image-37752 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/legends-of-tomorrow-season-1-episode-12-last-refuge-300x200.jpg" alt="legends-of-tomorrow-season-1-episode-12-last-refuge" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/legends-of-tomorrow-season-1-episode-12-last-refuge-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/legends-of-tomorrow-season-1-episode-12-last-refuge-768x513.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/legends-of-tomorrow-season-1-episode-12-last-refuge-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/legends-of-tomorrow-season-1-episode-12-last-refuge-620x414.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/legends-of-tomorrow-season-1-episode-12-last-refuge.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
Hey, the old &#8220;find the team&#8217;s younger selves&#8221; trope. I&#8217;m surprised that it took so long for this to happen. There was a lot of sciencey exposition necessary in this episode. This is the problem with any genre show that relies on such crazy plot devices. Eventually, things stop making sense and someone has to just say &#8220;this is how this works&#8221; or &#8220;this new piece of info is why the thing that makes sense isn&#8217;t happening&#8221;. Every sci-fi genre show is guilty of this. Luckily for <em>Legends</em>, it has an entire team of &#8220;every men&#8221; to stand in as the audience&#8217;s replacement for the sake of explanation. Overall, this was a good episode, but not a great one. It didn&#8217;t advance the plot. A problem was created last week and everything this week was devoted to its solution. By which, I mean murder. For a team of legends, these guys kill a whole bunch of people. And for everything Rip says about maintaining the time line, why hasn&#8217;t all this killing had any impact? Maybe it&#8217;ll come up, but I doubt it. This was an interesting episode because it revealed a little about the characters, which is necessary, if a bit late in the season. Luckily, most of these characters were established in <em>Arrow</em> and <em>Flash</em>, so this isn&#8217;t a huge problem. This wasn&#8217;t quite a bottle episode, but since nothing about the larger plot was resolved, I&#8217;m more excited for what&#8217;s coming than what&#8217;s happening now. I really want to get to the excitement, as such there is, of the Savage plot line.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn’t grow up playing video games. Although I participated in plenty of traditionally uncool activities (writing secret Redwall fanfiction in my journal, being really into gemstones, etc.), I missed the blessed time period where you easily learn stuff just by dint of being young and untainted by the evils of overthinking. When I got to college and realized that I lacked the hand-eye coordination to play any of the cool-looking video games my friends played, I threw up my metaphorical hands and decided, “Well, I don’t play video games.”</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2016. I am with my pals at PAX East, completely surrounded by a truly overwhelming number of games. My first impulse is to sweatily power-walk through the videogame section of the con to the tabletop gaming area. Tabletop games are safe! I don’t immediately get murdered if I don’t make a decision quickly enough! I don’t have to demo a game in front of 30 strangers who want to judge me for being a stupid fake gamer girl! I mean yes, I have played adventure exploration games like <em>Gone Home</em>, visual novels like <em>We Know the Devil</em>, and dipped my toes into the waters of ye olde dating sims with <em>Hatoful Boyfriend</em>, but I Don’t Play Video Games, right?</p>
<p>But this year is different, because 2016 is the year I discovered <em>Fire Emblem</em>. Though initially drawn to the game purely by my desire to “make the animes kiss,” it turns out that I actually really enjoy the tactics of the game. “Maybe I can play video games,” thought the nearly-30-year-old woman currently writing this article. Bolstered by this revelation, I made my way to the Indie Megabooth.</p>
<p>And do you know what I found there? Games that I can play! Games that I can play, and that I enjoyed! If you, like me, are a person of the “I Don’t Play Video Games” variety, I hope that you’ll shake away a bit of your gaming anxiety to check out one or more of these treasures from PAX East’s 2016 Indie Megabooth.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37762" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ladykillerinabind.jpg" alt="Lady Killer in a Bind" width="1600" height="900" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ladykillerinabind.jpg 1600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ladykillerinabind-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ladykillerinabind-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ladykillerinabind-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ladykillerinabind-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ladykillerinabind-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Ladykiller in a Bind</em></strong></p>
<p><em>My Twin Brother Made Me Crossdress As Him And Now I Have To Deal With A Geeky Stalker And A Domme Beauty Who Want Me In A Bind!!</em> or, <em>Ladykiller in a Bind</em> was initially the only game I really wanted to play at PAX. An erotic visual novel by Love Conquers All Games, Ladykiller in a Bind is a lesbian, BDSM dating sim that explores the art of manipulation and being a very, very bad girl. Playing as The Beast, you are tasked with surviving your twin brother’s celebratory graduation cruise while maintaining the illusion that you are your brother, The Prince. Luckily, The Beauty is at your side to act as a Fairy Domme-mother and give advice on how to maintain your princely disguise. Having played through a few different endings on the demo, I loved that the gameplay encourages a balance of “being good” and “being bad.” Yes, you can play the game without arousing any suspicion, but it’s way more fun to act out enough to merit The Beauty’s correction.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://ladykillerinabind.com/">Ladykiller in a Bind</a></em> comes out in the summer of 2016, but you can download a 5 minute teaser on the game’s website!</p>
<p><strong>Fake Gamer Difficulty Level</strong>: All you need to play this game is the ability to click your mouse and make decisions about the level of “bad girl” you want to achieve! (I recommend “very bad.”)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37763" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bmas03.png" alt="Burly Men at Sea " width="2731" height="1536" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bmas03.png 2731w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bmas03-300x169.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bmas03-768x432.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bmas03-1200x675.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bmas03-298x168.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bmas03-620x349.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 2731px) 100vw, 2731px" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Burly Men at Sea</em></strong></p>
<p>Burly Men at Sea is a folktale adventure that follows three bearded fisherman in an early 20<sup>th</sup> century Scandinavia-inspired setting. Playing through the demo of <em>Burly Men at Sea</em> in the midst of PAX’s show floor was a lovely experience. The minimalistic art and bright music of the game provided a much-appreciated respite from the chaos. David &amp; Brooke Condolora, the husband and wife team behind Brain &amp; Brain, explained that the player acts as the “storyteller and wayfinder” of the game rather than as a character themselves. Where many storytelling games require you to agonize over which decision is the “best” for the overall game, the Condoloras wanted decision-making in the game to be more impulse and interest-driven. There are no bad decisions in <em>Burly Men at Sea</em>, just different paths.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://burlymenatsea.com/">Burly Men at Sea</a></em> is currently in development and scheduled for release in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Fake Gamer Difficulty Level</strong>: <em>Burly Men at Sea</em> requires what I would call a “click and swoop” type of motion and a willingness to explore. This game is for everyone!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37765" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.54.23-PM.png" alt="Sometimes Always Monsters" width="1273" height="651" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.54.23-PM.png 1273w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.54.23-PM-300x153.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.54.23-PM-768x393.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.54.23-PM-1200x614.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.54.23-PM-298x152.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.54.23-PM-620x317.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1273px) 100vw, 1273px" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Sometimes Always Monsters</em></strong></p>
<p>When I asked the good folks at the Indie Megabooth if they had any storytelling games to recommend, they suggested <em>Sometimes Always Monsters</em>. In <em>Sometimes Always Monsters</em>, you are the married author of a controversial but popular book who is heading out on a promotional bus tour with a group of other authors. As you meet different characters, the story expands, revealing more about your own backstory and the friends and acquaintances around you. I really appreciated the level of character customization available in the game, from gender to race to sexuality. There is also a nice level of diversity in your companion options. The world of <em>Sometimes Always Monsters</em> feels deep and real, and I am excited to keep exploring the story unfolding in it.</p>
<p><em>Sometimes Always Monsters</em> is a sort-of sequel to Vagabond Dog’s <em>Always Sometimes Monsters</em>, but you don’t have to play the first game to understand the second. It is scheduled for release in 2016 and you can watch the teaser trailer <a href="http://www.vagabonddog.com/#sam-section">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fake Gamer Difficulty Level:</strong> The mechanics of <em>Sometimes Always Monsters</em> involve moving your character around via arrow keys, clicking on things, and making dialogue decisions. There don’t appear to be any terrible consequences from occasionally running into walls (other than people staring over your shoulder and judging you for your lack of hand-eye coordination).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37766" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.56.31-PM.png" alt="Orion Trail" width="1280" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.56.31-PM.png 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.56.31-PM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.56.31-PM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.56.31-PM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.56.31-PM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-6.56.31-PM-620x388.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p><strong>Orion Trail</strong></p>
<p><em>Orion Trail</em> is a mash up of Oregon Trail and Star Trek…do you know how many people are into both of those things? So many people! Including me! <em>Orion Trail</em> is a single-player space adventure game that follows the adventures of the good ship Galaxy Force as it travels the Orion Trail. You (the Captain) must ensure the survival of your crew by managing resources and successfully completing encounters and away missions until you reach your destination.</p>
<p>The encounters along the Orion Trail require you to utilize the right crewmembers with the right stats for each battle. In other words, don’t send a diplomat to do a fighter’s job, or there’s a good chance they’ll end up Extremely Dead. In this sense, <em>Orion Trail</em> is probably the most traditionally game-y game in this lineup, but it’s a pretty straightforward system. I will admit that I didn’t do super well the first time I played the game, but I enjoyed myself so much that I kept playing anyway. Any game that allows me to play as a bear and name my characters things like Sweaty Boy is good in my book. It also has funny dialog and a great soundtrack.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://oriontrail.schellgames.com/">Orion Trail</a></em> is available to play right now, so set your phasers to buy. (I am not sorry for this bad joke.)</p>
<p><strong>Fake Gamer Difficulty Level</strong>: You should probably actually read the directions before playing (unlike me, who just started without any instruction). Once I played a few encounters, I got the hang of things!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lucas Knight doesn&#8217;t have any shining armor. He&#8217;s the spoiled child of a wealthy white developer in Puerto Rico, and the most good he&#8217;s done is all in his head. He wishes things were different—that his father wasn&#8217;t a sneering aristocrat, that his Puerto Rican neighbors would actually accept him, that his mother hadn&#8217;t left—but does nothing to affect those changes. Day after day he gets drunk with his friends, stays out chasing girls, and recognizes his privilege only insofar as it makes him feel guilty.</p>
<p>Most of all he wishes he could free the house down the way of its curse. Years ago, a scientist committed some grave sin of cruelty or neglect, and his wife abandoned him. Now the house is shuttered, haunted. No bird will fly over it. No sounds issue from it. Lucas and his friends invent stories to explain the strangeness of the house, and sometimes Lucas remembers them, in between bouts of inebriation and casual sex.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-37669" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/25810644.jpg" alt="25810644" width="315" height="475" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/25810644.jpg 315w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/25810644-199x300.jpg 199w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/25810644-298x449.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /></p>
<p>It sounds like I&#8217;m describing an antagonist rather than a protagonist, and to a certain extent that&#8217;s true. Lucas isn&#8217;t an angel, and he isn&#8217;t so thoroughly damaged that his irresponsibility inspires pity. He knows better, in other words. But because we are privy to his inner life, we know that&#8217;s not all there is to him. He follows his impulses, but also his heart. He&#8217;s kind, and he knows justice from injustice. He&#8217;s also still reeling from his mother leaving him when he was a child, and he longs to drift out into a featureless ocean, to be free of the burden of his knowledge. Because he can&#8217;t change things. He can&#8217;t stop his father from developing luxury hotels that take advantage of the poor. He couldn&#8217;t stop his mother from abandoning him.</p>
<p>So when the chance comes to learn more about the mysterious inhabitant of the old, shuttered house, he leaps on it. After all, he might be able to help her, a girl his own age with intense eyes and poisonous skin. And when they can perhaps help rescue a disappeared girl, the younger sister of one of his flings, he literally flings himself into the path of a hurricane to do it.</p>
<p>Missing tourists, star-crossed nuns, and a choir of tongue-clucking mothers and aunties round out this passion play, and the island itself comes to be a character, asserting itself on the beaches and jungles and wind-whipped skies as a palpable and very interested presence. Love for Puerto Rico and sorrow for its long history is woven through the narrative. How good it is to see an author so thoroughly embrace a place as well as its characters, who are also excellently complex.</p>
<p>Though I do find that, on balance, the odd romance between Lucas and Isabel works, it could have used more fleshing out. More time, certainly, since the narrative rushes everything along at a breakneck pace. The urgency is a narrative necessity, since Lucas and Isabel are racing against time to save a girl&#8217;s life, but it makes their romance suspect as well as star-crossed. They can&#8217;t touch, after all. And since Lucas is a bit of a player, we never see whether this infatuation is grounds for a genuine love or merely a convenient receptacle for their misplaced feelings of abandonment and desperation. I certainly appreciate the departure from YA tropes, but pushing the true love angle doesn&#8217;t entirely ring true.</p>
<p>Other elements—the disappearance of the girls, the temporary vegetative relief for Isabel&#8217;s affliction&#8211;are too strange for reality but also lack the magical realism or mythologizing to make them seem true (Truth not being reality or vice versa, and all that), especially in a world where such mundane horrors (racism, imperialism) lurk. Yet other elements—the fever dreams, the existence of a poison child&#8211;are boldly mythic. The result is a hybrid that, while compelling, is not quite enough for me to suspend my disbelief and become thoroughly lost in the story.</p>
<p>Still, the sheer audacity it takes to bring together all these elements in a YA novel and mostly&#8211;99%&#8211;succeed is remarkable. My qualms are few and my admiration is strong. <em>A Fierce and Subtle Poison</em> is the antidote to ordinary romances and medieval magic—it&#8217;s a real original.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to Magic Gatherings!</p>
<p>Last week we talked about the major mechanics of <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em>, the hot new set on the block. This week we&#8217;re talking about sizing and archetypes. As I write, Pro Tour <em>Shadows over Innistrad </em>is happening in Madrid, so if you crave more <em>SoI </em>limited action, you could hardly do worse than to watch some of the best players in the world draft the new format.</p>
<p><strong>Sizing</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the chart for common creature sizes in <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em>:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37626" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SOI_LimitedReviewStats.jpg" alt="SOI_LimitedReviewStats" width="1228" height="325" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SOI_LimitedReviewStats.jpg 1228w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SOI_LimitedReviewStats-300x79.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SOI_LimitedReviewStats-768x203.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SOI_LimitedReviewStats-1200x318.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SOI_LimitedReviewStats-298x79.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SOI_LimitedReviewStats-620x164.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1228px) 100vw, 1228px" /></p>
<p>The big takeaway here is that powers and toughnesses tend to be tightly clustered around 2 and 3. 4-toughness creatures block pretty well; there aren&#8217;t many 4-power creatures, and they tend to have low toughness, so they risk trading down against weaker creatures. 5-toughness creatures are distinctly difficult to get through. As a 6/6, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Kessig Dire Swine">Kessig Dire Swine</a> is the largest natural creature in the format. Only <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Gatstaf Arsonists">Gatstaf Arsonists</a> and [Silburlind Snapper] can tussle with it at common.</p>
<p>That means a card that gives +3 to a stat is a substantial jump up the curve, one which does enough to work to make your creature difficult to block. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Spiteful Motives">Spiteful Motives</a> and  <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Equestrian Skill">Equestrian Skill</a> are pricey—and, as Auras, a little risky—but they offer a lot of power. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Hope Against Hope">Hope Against Hope</a> can be quite strong; it can give +3/+3 or more easily, and <em>first strike</em> matters a lot more when powers and toughnesses are more tightly bunched. +2/+2 (<a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Strength in Arms">Strength in Arms</a>, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Senseless Rage">Senseless Rage</a>) <em>can</em> be meaningful, but it&#8217;s not a guarantee.</p>
<p>This is a format that can produce some aggressive draws, but if your plan is to block, that should work out well. Consequently, while you can&#8217;t ignore the early game, you can expect the game to go long. What&#8217;s fun about the format is that aggressive decks have additional utility as the game drags out (Clues, <em>delirium</em>), while more controlling decks have the ability to put powerful engines in play that can take over the game.</p>
<p>What might those engines look like? What sorts of aggressive decks keep them honest? Glad you asked. Let&#8217;s take a look at the major archetypes.</p>
<p><strong>Major Archetypes</strong></p>
<p><em>Werewolves</em>—Chief of the Fun Police is the green-red Werewolf deck, which severely punishes decks that can&#8217;t make plays in the first few turns. We covered the transformation mechanic last week, but to review: if a turn goes by without a player casting a spell, all werewolves transform to their werewolf side. If a single player casts two spells on one turn, all werewolves transform back to their human side. This means it&#8217;s very dangerous to miss a play in the second, third, or fourth turns of the game. At the same time, werewolves&#8217; theriomorphic sides have some beefy stats, so the deck has play into the later turns as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37627" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_UlrichsKindred.png" alt="Card_UlrichsKindred" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_UlrichsKindred.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_UlrichsKindred-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></p>
<p>One wrinkle in <em>Shadows</em> limited is that it lacks the now-customary gold uncommon cards that point to major archetypes. Instead, we have a slightly more subtle cycle of cards with off-color activated abilities. In this case, it&#8217;s <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Ulrich&#8217;s Kindred">Ulrich&#8217;s Kindred</a>, which makes blocking tough for your opponent. (Play special attention to activated abilities for this deck, as they give you productive ways to spend your mana that don&#8217;t count as casting spells. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Duskwatch Recruiter">Duskwatch Recruiter</a> is an especially good one.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37628" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Howlpack.png" alt="Card_Howlpack" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Howlpack.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Howlpack-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the whole story, though. Each archetype has multiple powerful uncommons that aren&#8217;t multicolored, but still reward a dedicated strategy. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Howlpack Resurgence">Howlpack Resurgence</a> is obviously a &#8220;werewolf&#8221; card, but keep an eye out for more subtly synergistic cards that can aid your deck&#8217;s general plan.</p>
<p><em>Vampires</em>—I can&#8217;t do any better than one of the game&#8217;s true masters, who went 3-0 with this deck on Day 1 of Pro Tour <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em>:</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>As you can see, Vampires will typically be an aggressive black-red deck and will usually feature <em>madness</em> as a major theme. Last week I mentioned that <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Insolent Neonate">Insolent Neonate</a> was a real bellwether for <em>madness</em>: it&#8217;s a great card in decks that really abuse <em>madness</em>, but mediocre in decks that don&#8217;t. LSV&#8217;s deck features seven cards that naturally have <em>madness, </em>plus <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Falkenrath Gorger">Falkenrath Gorger</a>, which can give every vampire in the deck <em>madness</em>. Meanwhile, the &#8220;black-red&#8221; uncommon is <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Olivia&#8217;s Bloodsworn">Olivia&#8217;s Bloodsworn</a>, and LSV has managed to pick up a cool three copies.</p>
<p><a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Elusive Tormentor">Elusive Tormentor</a> over <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Olivia, Mobilized for War">Olivia, Mobilized for War</a> is a Pro Tour pick—pros highly value not committing to two colors right away, which is sounds strategy in a draft with such high stakes.</p>
<p><em>Zombies</em>—Less mechanically anchored than Vampires or Werewolves, Zombies will usually be a more controlling blue-black deck that gets value off discarding cards. Sometimes this will include <em>madness</em>, but other times it will be cards like <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Ghoulsteed">Ghoulsteed</a> and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Stitchwing Skaab">Stitchwing Skaab</a>, who can come back later. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Drunau Corpse Trawler">Drunau Corpse Trawler</a> is the marquee uncommon for this archetype; while expensive, its ability to grant <em>deathtouch</em> can be very difficult to attack into.</p>
<p><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37629" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_SpectralShepherd.png" alt="Card_SpectralShepherd" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_SpectralShepherd.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_SpectralShepherd-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></em></p>
<p><em>Spirits</em>—Like Zombies, Spirits is a deck that&#8217;s less mechanically emphatic, and more a particular expression of a classic draft archetype—in this case, white-blue flyers.  Not many creatures in <em>SoI </em>have <em>reach</em>, so flying creatures can be difficult to block. Defend yourself with a strong blocker like <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Silent Observer">Silent Observer</a>, and your air force can end the game. Keep an eye out for <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Essence Flux">Essence Flux</a>; it&#8217;s a good example of an uncommon that&#8217;s seeded for one archetype, but which has utility for other decks.</p>
<p><em>Humans</em>—The white-green archetype focuses on Humans. Cards like <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Intrepid Provisioner">Intrepid Provisioner</a>, <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Hope Against Hope">Hope Against Hope</a>, and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Veteran Cathar">Veteran Cathar</a> explicitly call out tribal synergies, but as my draft deck from last week&#8217;s article indicates, it can be enough to combine efficient green and white creatures with the staying power of cards like <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Dauntless Cathar">Dauntless Cathar</a> and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Nearheath Chaplain">Nearheath Chaplain</a>.</p>
<p><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37631" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Rise.png" alt="Card_Rise" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Rise.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Rise-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></em></p>
<p><em>Prowess/Spells Matter</em>—More and more, we&#8217;re seeing blue-red archetypes trend toward generic &#8220;play spells&#8221; decks. <em>Shadows</em> continues this pattern, featuring <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Sanguinary Mage">Sanguinary Mage</a> and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Niblis of Dusk">Niblis of Dusk</a> as commons with <em>prowess</em> alongside <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Pyre Hound">Pyre Hound</a>, which has a kind of &#8220;permanent prowess.&#8221; <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Rise from the Tides">Rise from the Tides</a> is a great example of an uncommon that can be stellar in this archetype, even though it&#8217;s not obviously pegged as a red/blue card—playing those colors together naturally leads one to play lots of spells, which makes Rise great. Look for <em>madness</em> themes here too, especially as you have access to <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Mad Prophet">Mad Prophet</a> and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Reckless Scholar">Reckless Scholar</a>.</p>
<p><em><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37357" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_GrafMole.png" alt="Card_GrafMole" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_GrafMole.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_GrafMole-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37356" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_FleetingMemories.png" alt="Card_FleetingMemories" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_FleetingMemories.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_FleetingMemories-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37632" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Ongoing.png" alt="Card_Ongoing" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Ongoing.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Ongoing-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />Investigation</em>—Blue and green play especially well with Clues, so decks focused on <em>investigate</em> will trend in that direction. But there are enough flexible engine cards that generate value from Clues (and generate Clues in different ways) that these decks can look and play very differently. As you draft these decks, make sure to include enough defensive cards that you can protect yourself in the early turns, as it can take time to set up. Prioritize cards that generate Clues over and over. If your engine is consistent, you should be able to take over in the late game.</p>
<p><em>Delirium</em>—Usually, Delirium decks will be black-green, taking advantage of cards like <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Crow of Dark Tidings">Crow of Dark Tidings</a> and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Vessel of Nascency">Vessel of Nascency</a> to stock the graveyard, then winning with cards like <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Autumnal Gloom">Autumnal Gloom</a>//<a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Ancient of the Equinox">Ancient of the Equinox</a>. Uncommons like <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Crawling Sensation">Crawling Sensation</a> and <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Call the Bloodline">Call the Bloodline</a> can help get various card types into the graveyard, while generating useful tokens at the same time.</p>
<p>While these cards are centered in black and green, all colors have cards with <em>delirium</em>, so the mechanic could potentially be a sub-theme in any number of decks. In these cards, pay special attention to artifacts and enchantments, as those are usually difficult to get into your graveyard. Cards like <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Wicker Witch">Wicker Witch</a> can be good role-players, because they give you an easy way to get an unusual card type into your discard pile.</p>
<p><strong>Drafting On</strong></p>
<p>While this quick review covers the major draft archetypes of <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em>, it&#8217;s not the whole story. <em>SoI</em> is a set that&#8217;s particularly rich in draft-around cards that can become the focus of decks in their own right—single-card archetypes, if you will. Keep your eyes peeled for cards that ask you to do something specific, and be open to the possibility of drafting around them. If it seems like fun, go for it! You probably can.</p>
<p>At the same time, if you find yourself in a color pair with an &#8220;established&#8221; archetype, be open to drafting a deck that has a different focus than you might expect. As we mentioned, <em>delirium</em> decks can span all colors, and often require very different cards than the &#8220;normal&#8221; archetype for a particular color pair. Always have a plan, and ask yourself what cards need to be in your deck for that plan to succeed.</p>
<hr />
<p>That&#8217;s all for this week! I&#8217;ll be back next week with a special deckbuilding exercise. In the meantime, if you happen to be at PAX East this weekend, come find me in Tabletop—I&#8217;m demoing a certain card game about cartoon horses that solve friendship problems. Feel free to stop by and say hello!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Red Woman</em> was a lot of catching up and setting up. This recap obviously contains spoilers from Season 6 Episode 1.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37738 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-premiere-season-6-jon-snow-300x225.jpg" alt="game of thrones premiere season 6 jon snow" width="727" height="545" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-premiere-season-6-jon-snow-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-premiere-season-6-jon-snow-768x576.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-premiere-season-6-jon-snow-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-premiere-season-6-jon-snow-620x465.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-premiere-season-6-jon-snow.jpg 1065w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The episode opens on Jon laying on the snow, with Ghost howling mournfully and trying desperately to get out of the chamber he&#8217;s locked in. Davos is being sad in his room, probably because Melisandre told him that Stannis and Shireen both died. He hears Ghost howling and decides to go check it out. He sees someone laying on the snow, runs down the stairs to check on the person, and sees that it is Jon. He is then joined by several Brothers of the Night&#8217;s Watch, including Dolorous Edd. They take Jon inside (for some reason, Davos stares super hard at where Jon&#8217;s body had been laying &#8211; any thoughts as to why?) and lay him on the table, while contemplating what to do. They know Jon&#8217;s death was Alliser&#8217;s doing and that they will all be slaughtered for guarding his body; there are only like 6 of them versus the rest of the Night&#8217;s Watch. Edd goes to get Ghost out of his room because having a direwolf on their side will be helpful. Melisandre pays them a visit and is super sad that Jon is dead because she saw him in the flames, fighting in Winterfell. Edd and the rest are ready to fight and die that night but Davos reminds them that there are more people who owe their lives to Jon than the men in that room, i.e. the Wildlings. Edd takes this hint and leaves to rally the Wildlings into helping them.<em><br />

<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37741 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jon-snows-direwolf-may-be-more-important-than-ever-300x225.png" alt="jon-snows-direwolf-may-be-more-important-than-ever" width="727" height="545" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jon-snows-direwolf-may-be-more-important-than-ever-300x225.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jon-snows-direwolf-may-be-more-important-than-ever-768x576.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jon-snows-direwolf-may-be-more-important-than-ever-298x224.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jon-snows-direwolf-may-be-more-important-than-ever-620x465.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/jon-snows-direwolf-may-be-more-important-than-ever.png 901w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Meanwhile, Alliser is doing rallying of his own &#8211; he needs to convince the rest of the Night&#8217;s Watch to join him. He owns up to the fact that he, along with a couple of others (some who look ashamed), killed Jon Snow. He admits that he never liked Jon but also never disobeyed him until Jon started to help the Wildlings, which he saw as the ushering of the end of the Night&#8217;s Watch. He thinks that Jon did what he thought was right but it would&#8217;ve destroyed the Night&#8217;s Watch so they made the &#8220;difficult&#8221; decision of murdering Jon. (Fucking Olly with his dumb smug face).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37739 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-season-6-300x169.jpg" alt="game-of-thrones-season-6" width="728" height="410" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-season-6-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-season-6-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-season-6-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-season-6-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-season-6-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-season-6.jpg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ramsay is sad about Myranda&#8217;s death &#8211; he talks about how he saw her for the first time when she was 11 and, while everyone else was already afraid of him, she was not. And also, she smelled like dog. He promises to avenge her death; he just wishes she was alive to watch him. The maester asks whether they should bury her or burn her and Ramsay says good meat is good meat &#8211; feed her to the hounds. Gross. Roose and Ramsay discuss their victory over the Baratheon army. Roose wants to commend the man who killed Stannis &#8211; IT WAS A LADY, ROOSE. He also chastises Ramsay for feeling like a victor because they will probably be soon facing a bigger and more well prepared Lannister army. If they defeat the Lannisters, only then should Ramsay feel like a victor. For now, there is more work to be done. Roose also reminds Ramsay that without Sansa, Ramsay won&#8217;t have an heir but guess who might have an heir on the way? Roose. If Ramsay wasn&#8217;t so terrible, I would feel bad for him because his dad is awful.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37736 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/635971302797978904-GOT601-081715-HS-DSC-2346-1-1-1-300x169.jpg" alt="635971302797978904-GOT601-081715-HS-DSC-2346-1-" width="726" height="409" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/635971302797978904-GOT601-081715-HS-DSC-2346-1-1-1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/635971302797978904-GOT601-081715-HS-DSC-2346-1-1-1-298x167.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/635971302797978904-GOT601-081715-HS-DSC-2346-1-1-1.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ramsay has his men and best hounds after Theon and Sansa, who are running through the snow covered forest. They cross an icy river so that the hounds can&#8217;t track their scent. It is so cold and Sansa almost doesn&#8217;t go for it but Theon tells him that dying in the cold river is better than what the hounds would do to them. (Question: how are their clothes not frozen stiff after they get out of the water and keep running in the cold?) They were wrong about the river throwing their scent off thing because they&#8217;re resting by a tree and guess who runs up on them? The men with the hounds. Theon tries to &#8220;head them off&#8221; by walking up to them and saying  Sansa died because of the jump and he left her there. But they are literally on the other side of the tree that Sansa is hiding behind. And they have tracking dogs. Seriously. The dogs say &#8220;uh, this dude is straight lying because I can smell Sansa &#8211; she&#8217;s right behind this tree&#8221;. They find Sansa and they&#8217;re in a pickle. But guess who comes to their rescue?? Captain Phasma, in a weird fanfic twist (I stole this goof from my friend, Arthur). Jk. Its Brienne and Pod! They kill the Bolton men, with a little help from Theon. After the fight, Brienne pledges her service to Sansa again and this time, Sansa accepts. Can we take a minute and talk about the dogs? 1. They used bloodhounds, which are good for tracking but are also the most goofiest looking lovable dogs. They would be last dogs to fuck you up. They looked like they were trying to smooch on Sansa. And, 2. can we all just pretend that the dogs got away and were not killed in this fight? Kthankx.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Jaime has finally reached King&#8217;s Landing with dead Myrcella. How long is the boat ride from Dorne to King&#8217;s Landing and how stinky is Myrcella&#8217;s body by now? Gross. Cersei is super excited that her daughter is back but when she goes to the harbor, she sees Jaime standing on the row boat with a shrouded body behind him &#8211; &#8220;Gold will be their crowns, and gold their shrouds&#8221;. Cersei is understandably devastated by Myrcella and tells Jaime about the witch&#8217;s prophecy. Jaime does not care about prophecies or fate &#8211; they will take back everything that has been taken from them and more. Sounds like the old terrible &#8220;I-push-kids-out-of-windows&#8221; Jaime will be making a comeback.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Margaery is still having a terrible time in her cell. She is terrified of Septa Unella and all she wants to know is how her brother is doing but the Septa won&#8217;t tell her unless she confesses. The High Sparrow stops by for a visit and, while Septa Unella is terrifying, the High Sparrow is sweet and kind. A real good cop/bad cop thing going on here. He tells her that Tommen misses her very much but in order for Margaery to get back to him, she needs to confess.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Everything is fine in Dorne. Doran and Ellaria are getting along and talking about Oberyn&#8217;s life and how the two brothers were suited for their roles in life &#8211; Doran as the Prince and Oberyn as the adventurer who had sex with dudes and dudettes, lest you forget. Then, Doran gets a message and before he can speak on it, all hell breaks lose. Tyene stabs Areo Hotah with a tiny knife, which, tbh, I don&#8217;t think would&#8217;ve done much damage to the huge, beefy Areo but he goes down like a sack of potatoes. As the palace guards watch, Ellaria stabs Doran in the chest and lets him bleed out. Clearly, the palace guards support Ellaria in her quest to seek revenge for Oberyn&#8217;s death. Doran dies calling after his son, Trystane, who should be on his way to King&#8217;s Landing with Jaime but apparently is in another boat? He is visited by the other two Sand Snakes, Nymeria and Obarra. How are they on the boat when they were on the pier when Jaime and Trystane left? I don&#8217;t get it. Anyway, Trystane chooses to take on Nymeria but Obarra stabs him through the back of his head. Not cool. I don&#8217;t really understand what is going to happen in Dorne &#8211; I guess  they will be joining the unrest in Westeros. I think it would&#8217;ve been more interesting to see how Cersei would&#8217;ve reacted to Trystane being in King&#8217;s Landing but you don&#8217;t always get what you want, especially in <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Tyrion and Varys are dressed like merchants and roaming around the abandoned streets of Meereen. Also, Varys is not a boy anymore&#8230;because he has no twig and berries. Good jape. Tyrion tries to give money to a lady holding a baby on the side of the road but in his broken Valyrian, he ends up telling her that he wants to eat her baby. Varys calms the lady&#8217;s fears and gives her the coins. Some people in Meereen are still holding out hope for Dany and talking about carrying on her work but most are scared of the Sons of the Harpy. Varys points out that the attack at the fighting pits was very well planned which means they are getting their orders from someone. While they discuss this, a stream of frightened people start running away from the harbor. Upon inspection, they find that their whole fleet of ships is on FIYAH.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Jorah and Daario are still riding around, looking for Dany. They find the remnants of Drogon&#8217;s kills but haven&#8217;t found her whereabouts yet. On the way, Daario comments about how frustrating it must be to want someone who doesn&#8217;t want you back and Jorah admits that it is very frustrating. They find a huge patch of grass that has been disturbed in a specific pattern &#8211; something was encircled by a Dothraki horde. In the middle of the grass pattern, Jorah finds the Dany dropped. He also checks on his greyscale, which seems to be spreading.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37743 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snzv4nt-300x200.jpg" alt="snzv4nt" width="725" height="483" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snzv4nt-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snzv4nt-768x513.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snzv4nt-1200x801.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snzv4nt-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snzv4nt-620x414.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snzv4nt.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dany is with the Khalasar, being made to walk beside some rude ass dudes. She lets on as if she doesn&#8217;t understand what they&#8217;re saying and it probably took some effort because those were some crude dudes. Once they stop to camp, she is taken in front of Khal Moro, whose wives tell him to kill her but this just intrigues him further. Khal Moro says there is nothing better than seeing a woman naked for the first time but his Bloodriders bring up other things that are better than that, like killing a Khal, plundering a village, etc. Okay, top 5 best things in life. Geez. This was a good goof. I enjoyed it a lot. Dany finally tells them who she is, rattling of her many titles, and is taken aback when they laugh at her and call her &#8220;Queen of Nothing&#8221;. Then she tells them she was the wife of Khal Drogo. This gets her some respect and keeps her safe from being raped (because the only way to not be raped is by being linked to a previously important dude *eye roll*). But, they&#8217;re also going to take her to Dosh Khaleen, where all the other widows of fallen Khals live out the rest of their lives. BORING.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Blind Arya is begging on the streets of Braavos. People pass her while talking about what happened to the Kingsguard at the brothel but she doesn&#8217;t seem to be listening. The Waif shows up and asks her if she&#8217;s listening to the people around her. She then hurls a stick at Arya and tells her to fight. Arya can&#8217;t see so she can&#8217;t fight but the Waif doesn&#8217;t care; she hits Arya a bunch and then leaves, telling her that she will be back the next day. Arya has got to get her shit together.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37742 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/melisandre-isnt-just-old-shes-centuries-old-1-300x225.png" alt="melisandre-isnt-just-old--shes-centuries-old" width="728" height="546" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/melisandre-isnt-just-old-shes-centuries-old-1-300x225.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/melisandre-isnt-just-old-shes-centuries-old-1-768x576.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/melisandre-isnt-just-old-shes-centuries-old-1-298x224.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/melisandre-isnt-just-old-shes-centuries-old-1-620x465.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/melisandre-isnt-just-old-shes-centuries-old-1.png 877w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Back at the Wall, Alliser promises to spare the lives of the men in the room with Jon&#8217;s body and let Davos leave with a fresh horse and food. Davos says they will think on it but after Alliser and co. leave, Davos tells the rest that Alliser and co. will definitely straight murder them all if they open the door. Davos thinks that Melisandre could help them because he has seen Melisandre do some crazy shit, as in the ghost baby that killed Renly. Melisandre is looking despondent in her room. She saw Stannis as the one King chosen by R&#8217;hllor but then he died. She saw Jon in the fire, fighting in Winterfell but then he died. So I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s questioning her faith and abilities. She goes to look at herself in the mirror, takes her dress off, and takes her choker off. MELISANDRE IS OLD AF, Y&#8217;ALL!! LIKE REALLLLLLLLLLY OLD. Old Melisandre gets in bed and goes to sleep. Does she do this every night or is she doing this because she is feeling defeated?</p>

<p>Season 6 is here and all our questions will be answered! Well, maybe not yet, but its a promising start and it sets up tons of great story lines for this season. This was a pretty standard episode 1 for <em>Game of Thrones,</em> as we get to check in on everyone to see how there summer was.</p>
<p>We check in on Dany, Arya, Sansa, and sleepy boy Jon Snow.

<p><em>Pyre</em> has the atmosphere you would expect from a game by Supergiant Games. When I got my hands on it at PAX East, I found the graphics to be lush, and the music to be beautiful just like their past games &#8211; <em>Bastion</em> and <em>Transistor</em>. What left me scratching my head a bit is that <em>Pyre</em> is also sports game.</p>

<p>You are exiled in a purgatory-like land, and the only way for you to return is to win the Rites. Literacy in the world of <em>Pyre</em> seems to have some sort of mystical power associated with it, and being able to read allows you to compete in the Rites. What are the Rites? You control a team of three players, and they must get a ball into a goal. You are opposed by another team which is AI controlled at this point. You can run into your opponents or shoot them from range and banish them from the field for a time. You can pass the ball to your teammate, and you can throw the ball into the goal, or run it in. <em>Pyre</em> is some sports-ass sports.</p>
<p>The game was already pretty fun, and I&#8217;m assuming by the release day in 2017, there will be extremely deep gameplay. It did feel like a bit of a strange choice, but I personally would give the team at Supergiant Games the benefit of the doubt. There were light RPG elements, and plenty of story in-between sports matches, but with the release date so far off, it is hard to say what the final product will look like. I look forward to keeping tabs on <em>Pyre</em> as it develops.</p>

<p>Whether you want to admit it or not, we are in the midst of the VR wars. Three huge companies are vying for your dollars in what they feel is the next &#8220;big thing&#8221; in entertainment. We all remember the &#8220;force feedback&#8221; wars of the early 2000&#8217;s. Hello six axis. These things are not cheap though, and you are probably wondering which headset you should invest in. Here are some quick impressions of each from this years PAX.</p>
<p>All three headsets (HTC Vive, Oculus, Playstation VR) are actually very similar in a lot of ways. They all have about the same field of view. If you cup your hands on the side of your face, that&#8217;s about what it looks like. They all use a lens to morph the screen and things get blurry around the edges of your vision if the headset isn&#8217;t set right on your head. You can also see the pixels on them, the screen door effect. This was pretty similar across the board. So all that being said, how do they differ?</p>
<p>I got to try Vive first at the show playing several games which I&#8217;ll go into more depth in a different article, but it&#8217;s easily the most impressive. It&#8217;s quite large and fits snugly around my glasses and was quite comfortable. It has two paddle controllers that are tracked in 3d space by the Lighthouse stations. Having a 1 to 1 connection with you and the game world is very immersive. It takes you out of just looking through a window and puts you there. You feel like you belong in the world.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-37641" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rift_hero-1200x540.jpg" alt="oculus" width="620" height="279" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rift_hero-1200x540.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rift_hero-300x135.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rift_hero-768x346.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rift_hero-298x134.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rift_hero-620x279.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rift_hero.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Immediately after playing with the Vive, I looked at the consumer Oculus. The Oculus feels the lightest on your head. It also feels solid and the most ready for heavy use. Unfortunately it is not glasses friendly. It actually hurt wearing my glasses under it. The performance was on par with the others but without the motion controls it is lacking right now behind the Vive for me.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37640" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/psvr.jpg" alt="playstation vr" width="1024" height="813" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/psvr.jpg 1024w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/psvr-300x238.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/psvr-768x610.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/psvr-298x237.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/psvr-620x492.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Later in the day I checked out the Playstation VR. This is by far the most comfortable headset to wear. They weren&#8217;t afraid of making it wider and having it just rest on your face. Unfortunately it was the only one that made me motion sick. This may be because it wasn&#8217;t tight enough and was moving slightly when I turned my head or it could just be the game was too intense. With games needing to be ultra responsive at 90fps, any hickups will cause motion sickness and I&#8217;m not sure the PS4 is up to the task.</p>
<p>If you already have the high end gaming PC and the space, get the Vive, if you&#8217;re everyone else lets wait and see. The games will make or break these things.</p>

A weird memoir-esque take on growing up in the rebel youth culture of the 90s in China, Mian Mian catalogs drugs, sex, and rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll with both poetic grace and furious honesty. It&#8217;s an almost wistful look at the miseries of a confused, increasingly capitalistic China and all the people who stumbled through its cracks.</p>

<p>2.<em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Change-What-Was-Communism-Yan-ebook/dp/B009SQE0JE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1460896048&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=change+mo+yan">Change</a> </em>(Mo Yan) &#8211; Mo Yan won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature, but this is not one of his bigger works. I suppose I should be recommending <em>Life and Death are Wearing Me Out</em>, about a bourgeois landowner who reincarnates as a series of unglamorous animals (it&#8217;s definitely more SFF), but I like <em>Change</em> better. It&#8217;s shorter and more direct in its criticism of the Chinese government, laying things out in plain prose. Take your pick, but those are my recommendations over his more famous works.</p>

But it&#8217;s still magical. These are some of my favorite poems, reflections of the mundane and the daringly rebellious refracted through the gorgeous language of of a modern master. At times blunt, at times shimmering, and always insightful, I read this book of poems through almost like a novel.</p>

It&#8217;s more fun than profound, but it does offer some insights into a girl and a world not so different from a girl here in America. Chun Sue is flighty but fascinating, and she wrote this as a memoir of her youth while still in her youth, not even out of her teens.</p>

This is a take on the  Chinese myth-history during the building of the Great Wall. It&#8217;s viscerally weird, a story in which Binu&#8217;s immoderate crying is a curse, and then a blessing that brings her her beloved husband, and finally a force of nature that undoes the work of an empire. More magical realism than magic proper, but still full of fairy-tale characters and situations.</p>

Translated by another SF great-in-the-making Ken Liu, whose own <em>Paper Menagerie</em> is wowing critics and readers right now. &#8216;Nuff said.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-37583" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/maxresdefault-e1461268769563-300x154.jpg" alt="maxresdefault" width="725" height="372" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/maxresdefault-e1461268769563-300x154.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/maxresdefault-e1461268769563-768x395.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/maxresdefault-e1461268769563-1200x618.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/maxresdefault-e1461268769563-298x153.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/maxresdefault-e1461268769563-620x319.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Reek</strong> is back in Winterfell, serving the Boltons, the new Wardens of the North. When he sees Sansa arriving at Winterfell, he avoids her. When Myranda leads Sansa to Reek, he tells her that she shouldn&#8217;t be there with him. He is terrified of what Ramsay will do to him but Ramsay forgives him. However, Ramsay wouldn&#8217;t give up a chance to mentally and emotionally torture Reek, so he makes Reek apologize to Sansa for murdering Bran and Rickon. He also suggests that Reek is to walk Sansa down the aisle at their wedding.  At the wedding, Sansa refuses to allow Reek to hold her arm. Reek still walks her through the Godswood and gives her away. After the wedding, Ramsay orders Reek to stay in the room and watch him rape Sansa. Later, Reek takes Sansa her food, who tries to remind him that he is Theon Greyjoy who betrayed her family. She also tells him that he can redeem himself by lighting a candle in the broken tower to signal Brienne and Podrick to come rescue her. On his way back, he seems to contemplate it but decides to tell Ramsay of Sansa&#8217;s plan instead, sparing her from more pain to come.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">When he brings her food again, Sansa confronts Reek about why he told Ramsay about her plans. He tries to explain that he did it to protect her because every time Theon tried to escape, Ramsay found him and punished him. He also tells her that he deserves what happened to him for killing &#8220;those boy&#8221;. After Sansa demands to know why he should be alive but her brothers dead, he breaks down and tells her that Bran and Rickon are alive. After Sansa breaks out of her room and lights the candle in the tower, she is confronted by Reek and Myranda, who has a bow pointed at Sansa. Sansa is ready to die but Myranda says she will just maim her. Reek is not willing to let Sansa suffer so he pushes Myranda off the catwalk to her death. Theon then grabs Sansa and  they run. Knowing they will have to face Ramsay&#8217;s anger when he finds Myranda&#8217;s body, they have no choice but to jump from the parapet to the snow below.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Stannis</strong> is still at the Wall, trying to rebuild his army &#8211; by demanding Mance bend the knee and swear his wildling army to Stannis. When Mance refuses, Stannis has him burned alive. He also offers to legitimize Jon as a Stark and the Lord of Winterfell if he bends the knee and swears loyalty to Stannis, which Jon refuses twice. After Jon is chosen as the Lord Commander of the Night&#8217;s Watch, Stannis watches Jon as he trains with the new recruits and, in conversation with his wife, Selyse, alludes that he doesn&#8217;t think Jon is actually Ned&#8217;s son. Selyse also laments not having given Stannis a son. Later, his daughter, Shireen, comes to visit him and asks him if he&#8217;s ashamed of her. They have a sweet father-daughter moment, where he tells her that when people told him to send her away to Valyria because of her greyscale, he ignored them and instead, sent for anyone who could treat her, which saved her life &#8211; all because she is his daughter.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/stannis-has-lost-it.gif?w=1000" alt="" width="726" height="398" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Stannis&#8217; army marches on Winterfell but he lends his fleet of ships to Jon so he can rescue wildlings from Hardhome. Oh and he&#8217;s taking Selyse and Shireen with him, because war is where they will be safer. But they have a real tough go because the weather is terrible. The horses start dying and some of the sellswords abandon them but Stannis will not listen to Davos&#8217; advise of turning back to Castle Black &#8211; victory or defeat, they will march on Winterfell. Melisandre has a plan: they need a King&#8217;s blood sacrifice to get luck back on their side. She&#8217;s talking about sacrificing Shireen, which shocks and angers Stannis. Later, Ramsay Bolton and his men steal into Stannis&#8217; camp and set fires, which results in the loss of men, horses, and nearly all of the food. Facing this enormous setback, Stannis agrees to Melisandre&#8217;s suggestion of sacrificing Shireen, his own goddamn daughter who he had a sweet moment with earlier, talking about the lengths he went to in order to save her life. THAT SAME GODDAMN DAUGHTER. SWEET SHIREEN. FUCKING STANNIS. He knows Davos will try to prevent Shireen&#8217;s death (because Davos is a decent human being, unlike Stannis), so he sends Davos to the Night&#8217;s Watch to get more food. They tie Shireen to the stake and the pyre is lit, as Shireen begs and pleads for her life. Stannis is unmoved but Selyse has a change of heart and tries to run to her, only to be restrained by Baratheon soldiers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37596 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thrones-02-300x169.jpg" alt="thrones-02" width="726" height="409" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thrones-02-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thrones-02-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thrones-02-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thrones-02-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thrones-02-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Apparently, the blood sacrifice worked because the weather is way better the next morning. But the morning also brings news of Selyse&#8217;s death &#8211; she wasn&#8217;t able to live with what they had done so she hung herself. Melisandre has also fled but Stannis is still determined to march on Winterfell, with half of his forces and none of the sellswords. His forces meet the Bolton forces in an open field but his army stands no chance against the Bolton army. Stannis himself is injured, and after taking out a couple more Bolton soldiers, he props up against a tree. This is where Brienne finds him, who asks him if he used blood magic to kill Renly and he admits as much. Brienne asks him for his final words, but he just tells her to do her duty and she brings her sword down on him.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Roose</strong> is in Winterfell, reminding Ramsay to lay off flaying Northern lords because they don&#8217;t have enough men to hold off an uprising by the Stark bannermen, especially since their pact with the Lannisters was made with Tywin, who is now dead. His plan to hold the North is to have Ramsay marry into a good Northern family, and what better family than Stark! He has arranged with Petyr to have Sansa marry Ramsay. Yipee. He still doesn&#8217;t really trust Petyr and questions repercussions from Cersei when she finds about the marriage but Petyr tries to assuage his doubts by saying Lannisters have lost a great deal of power as a result of Tywin&#8217;s death. Roose is also increasingly getting annoyed with Ramsay&#8217;s tactics, especially of emotionally torturing Sansa at dinner so Roose announces that he and his wife, Walda, are expecting a son. Take that, Ramsay. When Ramsay confronts Roose about his announcement, they have a touching father-son moment, wherein Roose recounts the story of how Ramsay was conceived &#8211; Roose raped the miller&#8217;s wife under the miller&#8217;s hanging body. He also tells Ramsay that he almost killed both his mother and him but didn&#8217;t when he saw Ramsay&#8217;s face and realized that he was Roose&#8217;s son after all. Ah, sweet family stories. Later, he officiates Sansa&#8217;s marriage to Ramsay.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In order to defeat Stannis, Roose proposes to wait out Stannis&#8217; siege by staying inside the castle but Ramsay tells him to meet Stannis in the open field, and that he would need 20 good men to go sabotage Stannis&#8217; camp. The Bolton men soundly defeat the Baratheon army, but the battle gives just enough time for Sansa and Theon to escape, which means the claim to the North also is out of the Bolton&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">When <strong>Ramsay</strong> meets Sansa, he is very polite and even promises Petyr that he will not harm her, like anyone believes that. Myranda is hella jealous of Ramsay&#8217;s proposed marriage to Sansa because he had promised to marry her when he was still a bastard. When she threatens to marry someone else, Ramsay reminds her what he does with people that bore him. Later, he confronts Reek about Reek&#8217;s conversation with Sansa and reminds him to not keep secrets from him. At dinner, he toys with Sansa&#8217;s emotions by ordering Reek to apologize to her for killing Bran and Rickon, which annoys Roose into announcing that Walda is preggo with a son. This does not sit well with Ramsay, since a legitimate son of Roose means competition for Ramsay as heir to House Bolton.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">After his wedding to Sansa, he rapes her and forces Reek to watch. He continues to beat and rape Sansa the next couple of days. When Reek tells Ramsay of Sansa&#8217;s plan to escape with the help of Brienne and Pod, he flays Sansa&#8217;s elderly maid who delivered Brienne&#8217;s message to Sansa. He makes Sansa look at the corpse and boasts about how he will be the next Warden of the North after his father, but Sansa reminds him that Walda is having a boy who may be Roose&#8217;s true heir, since Ramsay was legitimized by Tommen, who himself is a bastard. Ramsay counters by saying even bastards can rise like her half-brother Jon, who, unbeknownst to her, is the new Lord Commander of the Night&#8217;s Watch.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As Stannis&#8217; army approaches Winterfell, Roose suggest waiting out the siege in the castle but Ramsay urges him to meet Stannis in the open field, and lays out his plan to sabotage the Baratheon camp. He takes 20 men, steals into the camp, sets fire to tents, and flees back to Winterfell. When Stannis still charges on Winterfell, Ramsay leads the Bolton army and massacres the Baratheon men. He is unaware that Myranda is dead and that Theon and Sansa have escaped from the castle.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sansa</strong> is still in the Eyrie under the alias of Alayne when Petyr receives a raven and they depart, leaving Robin in the care of Lord Royce. They are traveling west even though Petyr told Lord Royce that they would be going to the Fingers &#8211; Petyr tells her that they are going somewhere she will be safe from Cersei. On their way, they stop at an inn for lunch, where Brienne and Pod also happen to stop. Upon recognizing Sansa, she declares herself for Sansa but Sansa rejects her offer of service and watches Brienne defeat Petyr&#8217;s men and escape. When they make it to Moat Cailin, Sansa finds out that they are headed to Winterfell, where she is to marry Ramsay. While initially reluctant, she is pacified by Petyr who tells her to claim this opportunity to avenge her family. When they arrive at Winterfell, they are greeted politely by the Boltons and the servant who brings Sansa to her told room also expresses joy at having a Stark back in Winterfell and tells her that &#8220;The North Remembers&#8221;.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Sansa visits the Stark family crypts, where she is found by Petyr, who tells her that he&#8217;s been called back to Kings Landing. He reminds her that if Stannis wins the North, she needs to be in Winterfell so that he can declare her the Wardeness of the North. If Stannis loses, she is betrothed to Ramsay and, since she learned manipulation from Petyr himself, needs to win control of the North and House Bolton from within. While in her room, her maid bring Sansa a message and tells her that if she&#8217;s ever in trouble, she has to to light a candle in the highest window of the Broken Tower and help will come. Later, Myranda pretends to be friendly and tries to &#8220;help&#8221; Sansa remember her home by taking her to the kennels and showing her Reek. Reek tells Sansa she shouldn&#8217;t be down there and seeing him in this state, Sansa storms away. At dinner, Ramsay torments Sansa and Reek by making Reek apologize to Sansa for killing her brothers.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In preparation of the wedding, Myranda draws a bath for Sansa and warns her to never bore Ramsay by giving her examples of what happens when he does get bored of people. Sansa tells Myranda to cut the crap and asks Myranda if she really expected Ramsay to marry her. She also tells her that she is a Stark of Winterfell and not intimidated by her stories. After she has gotten ready for the wedding, Reek comes to escort her down the Godswood but she refuses to let him take her arm, even when he pleads to do so saying Ramsay will punish him otherwise. She and Ramsay are married.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">A few days after the wedding, Sansa is living as the Boltons&#8217; prisoner. When Reek brings her food, she tries to get him to help her but he refuses, telling her that she is Ramsay&#8217;s wife and needs to do what he says or he will hurt her &#8211; he is capable of much worse than what she has experienced. When Reek tries to leave, Sansa tells him he can redeem himself by playing a candle in the Broken Tower and reminding him that he is Theon Greyjoy, the son of Balon Greyjoy. It seems like he will help her but he tells Ramsay of her plans instead, which leads to Ramsay flaying Sansa&#8217;s maid. Ramsay makes Sansa look at the corpse but on the way back, Sansa steals a corkscrew. When Reek comes to her room with her next meal, she demands to know why he betrayed him and tells him that she is okay with everything Ramsay has done to torture him. Reek sadly acknowledges that he deserved what he got for murdering &#8220;those boys&#8221;. Her murdered brothers being referred to as &#8220;those boys&#8221; enrages Sansa and she demands to know why Reek is alive while her brothers are dead. Theon admits to her that the boys he killed were not Bran and Rickon.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">While the battle between the Boltons and the Baratheons is raging, Sansa attempts her escape. She picks the lock with the corkscrew she stole and lights the candle in the Broken Tower. She runs into Reek and Myranda, who threatens Sansa with a bow. Sansa says she&#8217;s ready to die but Myranda says she&#8217;s only going to maim her but leave the parts that Ramsay needs to produce his heir. Before Myranda can hurt Sansa, Theon grabs her and throws her off the battlement, to her death. Theon and Sansa jump off the castle walls and into the snow below, hoping to survive and escape the Boltons.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Remember how <strong>Arya</strong> got on that ship at the end of Season 4? Well she&#8217;s now in Braavos and makes it to the House of Black and White. She knocks on the door but is rejected from entrance by an old man even though she shows him the coin Jaqen gave her. She stays outside the House for several days, reciting the list of names of people she wants to kill but she eventually tosses the coin and wanders off. She is hunting pigeons and encounters a group of boys who want to take Needle from her. She is ready to kill them but the boys scatter when the old man from the House shows up. Arya follows him back to the House and demands to know his identity. He gives her her coin back and his face morphs into Jaqen but insists that he is not Jaqen &#8211; he is no one and she must learn to be so as well.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Inside the House, Arya cleans while people come in to drink from the temple&#8217;s well and pray. Arya tells Jaqen she wants to learn but Jaqen tells her &#8220;Valar Dohaeris&#8221; or &#8220;all men must serve&#8221; and tells her she isn&#8217;t ready because she only wants to serve herself. Later, she is attacked and beaten by the Waif, who repeatedly asks who Arya is and keeps hitting her when Arya answers &#8220;no one&#8221;. Jaqen makes the Waif stop and notices that Arya still has Needle. He tells her she can&#8217;t be no one while she is in possession of Arya Stark&#8217;s things, so Arya throws her clothing and silver in the water but hides Needle under some rocks. Later, Jaqen escorts Arya into an inner chamber where she helps the Waif strip and clean the corpses. Arya wants to know what happens to the bodies after they&#8217;re cleaned but the Waif doesn&#8217;t tell her. Arya wants to play the game of faces but the Waif tells her that she&#8217;s tried playing already but failed. She also implies that in order to pass the game of faces, Arya needs to learn how to lie convincingly. While she is asleep, Jaqen wakes her up and asks her who she is, to which she tell him how she came to join the Faceless men but tries to slip in a lie here and there but each time, Jaqen is able to tell she&#8217;s lying and hits her. Later, in the temple, a grieving father brings his sick daughter and Arya makes up a story about herself being sick and how her father brought her there, how she drank from the well, and was healed, persuading the girl to drink from the poisoned well. Having proven that she could lie, Jaqen takes her to the Hall of Faces, where all the faces had been taken from the corpses cleaned at the House. Jaqen asks her if she&#8217;s ready to give up who she is to become no one and after a few moments, he tells her she&#8217;s not ready to become no one but she&#8217;s ready to become someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/557edc0eca2dc24e4d26a053/master/w_690,c_limit/got-check-in-arya.gif" alt="" width="727" height="355" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Her first assignment is to be a shellfish monger and watch the &#8220;Thin Man&#8221; but she gets distracted because she sees a familiar face, Meryn Trant, who is in Braavos accompanying Mace Tyrell. That night, she follows him to a brothel, where she sees Trant seek out very young girls. The next night, Trant is given 3 girls who he beats; two whimper in pain but one makes no sound. He dismisses the other two but keeps the one and continues to hit her, until she&#8217;s on  the ground. She removes her face and shows that she is Arya. She stabs him in the eyes and chest. She asks him if he remembers Syrio Forel and then asks him if he knows who she is. She tells him she is Arya Stark and slits his throat. Back at the House, she puts the face she stole back on the wall but is caught by Jaqen and the Waif. She has taken a life that was not hers to kill and &#8220;only death can pay for life&#8221;. She think she&#8217;s going to be poisoned but instead, Jaqen drinks the poison and dies. While Arya is grieving over Jaqen, the Waif questions her grief and reveals herself to be Jaqen. Arya removes face after face from the dead Jaqen&#8217;s body until she sees her own face. She becomes blind as punishment for her disobedience.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Jon</strong> is tasked with convincing Mance to bend the knee to Stannis, which Mance refuses so Stannis has him burned alive but Jon puts Mance out of his misery by shooting him through the heart. Stannis tries to convince Jon to bend the knee to him by promising to legitimize him as a Stark and making him the Lord of Winterfell but its a no go. After Jon tells Samwell about Stannis&#8217; proposition and that he&#8217;s going to refuse it, Sam puts Jon up for the position of Lord Commander of the Night&#8217;s Watch. The votes are tallied and there is a tie between Alliser Thorne and Jon but Maester Aemon breaks the tie by voting for Jon. Stannis approaches Jon with his offer again but as the new Lord Commander of the Night&#8217;s Watch, Jon is even more steadfast on his refusal. He says that even though it has always been his dream to be a Stark, his place is with the Night&#8217;s Watch. Stannis respects his decision and leaves after telling Jon of his plans to march on Winterfell. However, Davos stays and tells Jon that maybe the Night&#8217;s Watch&#8217;s pledge to be &#8216;the shield that guards the realms of men&#8217; doesn&#8217;t only mean protecting from beyond the wall but also protecting the Kingdom itself from suffering.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">At a meeting of the Night&#8217;s Watch, Jon names Alliser as the First Ranger and assigns Janos Slynt to man and repair Greyguard, which he refuses and openly insults Jon. Having disobeyed his Commander, Jon orders Janos to be taken outside and asks Olly to fetch Longclaw. Janos tries to takebacksies but Jon doesn&#8217;t relent, executing him with a single blow. Janos also betrayed Ned in Kings Landing, so Jon got to exact a small revenge. Later, Melisandre tries to get into Jon&#8217;s pants because she has sensed something powerful about him but he turns her down for the love he still bears for Ygritte.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Jon has to make a decision with what to do with the wildings: let them fall into the hands of the White Walkers or help them escape and settle south of the Wall. The Night&#8217;s Watch Brothers are not into helping the wildlings at all but Maester Aemon tells him to do what he thinks is best &#8211; &#8220;Kill the boy, and let the man be born&#8221;. He asks Tormund to go to Hardhome, the wildling fishing village, and negotiate with them. Tormund agrees but only if Jon goes with so that the wildlings don&#8217;t think its a trap. Jon borrows ships from Stannis for the trip to Hardhome. He leaves Castle Black in the hands of Thorne and Sam gives him a bag of dragonglass, just in case.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37618 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-s05-e-08-agambiarra-3-300x169.jpg" alt="game-of-thrones-s05-e-08-agambiarra-3" width="726" height="409" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-s05-e-08-agambiarra-3-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-s05-e-08-agambiarra-3-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-s05-e-08-agambiarra-3.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-s05-e-08-agambiarra-3-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-s05-e-08-agambiarra-3-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At Hardhome, they meet Rattleshirt, who is a real dick to Jon so Tormund kills him. They then go in a hut to speak with the wildling leaders: Jon tells him he will share the dragonglass with them and allow them to settle in the south, if they help him against the coming war with the White Walkers. Most of the wildlings agree to leave with them but some decide to stay. While they are preparing to leave, they are attacked by an army of wights, during which battle, Jon discovers that White Walkers can also be killed by Valyrian Steel. Jon and Edd get to the ships and the wights don&#8217;t pursue them in water. The Night&#8217;s King stares at Jon while raising the newly dead to join his army.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37619 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jon-and-Sam-300x198.png" alt="Jon-and-Sam" width="727" height="480" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jon-and-Sam-300x198.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jon-and-Sam-768x506.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jon-and-Sam-298x196.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jon-and-Sam-620x409.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jon-and-Sam.png 874w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Back at Castle Black, his relationship with the rest of the Night&#8217;s Watch is strained. Sam asks to leave to go to Oldtown with Gilly and the baby so that he can train to be a maester. Jon reluctantly agrees and sees Sam off. Davos returns from Stannis&#8217; camp to ask for supplies and men but Jon refuses, pointing out the Night&#8217;s Watch&#8217;s neutrality. Their argument is broken up by the arrival of Melisandre, who confirms the deaths of Stannis and Shireen. Later that night, Olly comes to Jon, telling him that one of new wildlings knows the whereabouts of Benjen, Jon&#8217;s uncle. Elated, Jon hurries downstairs but instead of a wildling, he finds a sign marked &#8220;Traitor&#8221;. Thorne is the first to stab Jon while uttering &#8220;for the Watch&#8221;, followed by several other Brothers, including Olly. I hate that fucking kid. Jon collapses and dies from his wounds, as his blood stains the ice and snow around him.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37574" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/green-lantern-corps.jpg" alt="green lantern corps" width="480" height="738" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/green-lantern-corps.jpg 480w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/green-lantern-corps-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/green-lantern-corps-298x458.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<h2>Green Lantern Corps: Edge of Oblivion #4 (DC Comics)</h2>
<p><em>Writer: Tom Taylor</em><br />
<em>Pencils: Adrian Syaf</em></p>
<p><strong>First Impressions:</strong> From the beginning, <em>Edge of Oblivion</em> has been a rough series. Whether it’s due to the limited format, the difficult starting point of the story, or the random chance of the universe; the series has never really found its feet. We’re now four issues into the six-part miniseries and, while I always retain a hopeful outlook, my first impression is that I will once again be disappointed. While Ethan Van Sciver has done yet another stellar cover, the fact that he is no longer doing the inner art has me worried. Even so, last month’s issue did end on an interesting cliff-hanger with Marniel having stolen Guy’s ring and winning quite handily. Perhaps there’s hope yet?</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> I am pleasantly surprised. I’m hardly salivating at the mouth in anticipation for the next issue, but equally I have no desire to hurl the book across the room. Taylor does a good job healing the rift between Killowog and Guy, only if it&#8217;s because he’s made the decision to literally muzzle guy. The twist that comes afterwards wherein Marniel is in fact a force for good and Asuras and Dismas are decidedly evil is also handled surprisingly well by the end. Taylor slips back momentarily into the heavy-handedness when he has Marnial fight our heroes yet again for no real reason. This is partially forgiven as Syaf does a stellar job with a two page spread explaining her background and the visual of Dismas about to chow down on a few hapless aliens is suitably unsettling. My largest gripe is naming Asuras and Dismas ‘The Blackest Knights’. <em>Blackest Night</em> was an excellent crossover and it influenced <em>Green Lantern</em> for months afterwards. It is seven years old now and should really be put to rest. With the story perhaps finally back on track, I am firmly, mildly, anticipating next month’s issue.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37575" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/green-lantern.jpg" alt="green lantern" width="640" height="984" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/green-lantern.jpg 640w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/green-lantern-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/green-lantern-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/green-lantern-620x953.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>Green Lantern #51 (DC Comics)</h2>
<p><em>Writer: Robert Venditti</em><br />
<em>Pencils: Rafa Sandoval</em></p>
<p><strong>First Impressions:</strong> I’ve read <em>Green Lantern</em> for many years now, I’m (I would like to think) fairly familiar with most aspects of <em>Green Lantern</em> lore from the past 9 or 10 years, so the Grey Agents have me interested. Sandoval has done a great job whipping up a dynamic and visually interesting cover. That said, the greatest cover in the world can’t make up for a weak story. The hasty conclusion last month to Hal and Parallaxes battle does make me worry that we’ll be in for more of the same.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> It’s a month for unexpected surprises it seems. After an oddly short and poorly drawn issue 50, preceded by a couple of the dullest <em>Green Lantern</em> issues in a long time, it would seem that Venditti has managed to turn it around. After only a mildly clunky piece of exposition wrapping up things on Earth, Hal Jordan takes to space once more. The story then shifts back to Virgo, Trapper and Darlene; who are quite honestly the real stars of the series. The threat of the Grey Agents is set up well with Virgo and Trapper taken down with a variety of aliens in a matter of pages. Their purpose, like any good villain, remains to be seen. Venditti has managed to create an exciting and new threat for the last few issues of <em>Green Lantern</em> and Sandoval’s art is the best it’s been for several issues. Apart from a couple of wonky faces, he really shines here. Incorporating dynamic panel layouts and seriously cool alien designs, this is probably one of the better looking <em>Green Lantern</em> issues in a while. I do have some doubts due to the DC Rebirth coming up soon, but I’m really hoping that Venditti is able to take these solid beginnings to a new story and bring it all home.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37577" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/survivors-club.jpg" alt="survivors club" width="900" height="1384" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/survivors-club.jpg 900w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/survivors-club-195x300.jpg 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/survivors-club-768x1181.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/survivors-club-780x1200.jpg 780w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/survivors-club-298x458.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/survivors-club-620x953.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h2>Survivors Club #7 (Vertigo)</h2>
<p><em>Writer: Dale Halvorsen and Lauren Beukes</em><br />
<em>Artist: Ryan Kelly</em></p>
<p><strong>First Impressions:</strong> Last month’s issue of <em>Survivors Club</em> was exactly the sort of thing you want near the end of an arc (I assume it’s near the end, but it wouldn’t be the first time I was wrong). With half our main characters trapped in the Muskagee House with Mr Empty and Zira, Teo and Kiri headed to face Akheron, its seems <em>Survivors Club</em> has placed them all in awful situations. The kind of situations this series does best. With yet another brilliant, blood-soaked cover from Bill Sienkiewicz, I’m expecting big things.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> It’s nice to be right. Once again Halvorsen and Beukes have crafted a masterful story that kept me on my toes the whole way through. The showdown with Akheron delivers wonderfully with Halvorsen and Beukes evoking just the right level of psychological horror, character introspection and a healthy dose of gore. In the parallel story, things go very poorly in Muskagee House and artist Ryan Kelly’s demented penchant for blood, shadows, and creepiness is in full force. Mr. Empty has been strongly hinted from day one as the real threat behind Harvey, and to have him come to the fore, blood soaked scissors and all, is fantastic. When Teo accidentally gives birth to a spider woman that begins to do battle with Kiri’s ghost aunt, the whole thing ramps up to 11. Any other story it would be ridiculous, but in <em>Survivors Club</em> it’s just par for the course. Over the last seven issues, the story has been building and building and it’s incredibly satisfying to have such a solid payoff, even if it’s still not done. What began as a fairly stock standard horror comic has quickly turned into something else entirely that simply must be read.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37578" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TheAutumnlands.png" alt="TheAutumnlands" width="585" height="900" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TheAutumnlands.png 585w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TheAutumnlands-195x300.png 195w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TheAutumnlands-298x458.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></p>
<h2>The Autumnlands #10 (Image)</h2>
<p><em>Writer: Kurt Busiek</em><br />
<em>Art: Benjamin Dewy and Jordie Bellaire</em></p>
<p><strong>First Impressions:</strong> <em>The Autumnlands</em> is a series that has consistently impressed from day one. Busiek’s highly vivid and fascinating world perfectly complements what is fast becoming a highly intriguing story. After what was essentially a set up arc for the world of <em>The Autumnlands</em>, I’m full of excitement and anticipation as to how he constructs a longer running story. Dewey and Bellaire have once again produced a fine, minimalist cover that promises a good old fashioned environmental mystery, no doubt the goods will be delivered.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> So, apparently this issue of <em>The Autumnlands</em> was late. I didn’t really notice. But, if this is the sort of quality we’ll be getting if the series is late, the team needs to keep taking their time. The story is massively intriguing for one. Up until now, the only other human we have seen other than Leroy is a woman that I’m still convinced wasn’t even real. So why then is there a woman on top of the mountain? And why does she explode? Where is the magic coming from? Will there ever be an issue of this series that doesn’t fill me with all kinds of burning questions? Probably not. But Busiek also does well when things aren’t exploding. With Dusty and Leoroy essentially the only characters now, it’s great to see a little time spent exploring their relationship and their differences and the tension over the sheep village last issue is raised again with the arrival of an injured goat man. The story is typical solid fare and I can’t wait for next month; but special mention must go to the art. This issue of <em>The Autumnlands</em> is hands down one of the best looking comics I have read in a long time. The line work is crisp and excellent, the colors are vibrant and there is a real painting-like quality to the whole thing that elevates the entire issue. I’m not much of an art guy, but the more I read of this comic, the more that changes. The first trade paperback is out now. If you haven’t yet, go get it.</p>

<h2>Black Road #1 (Image)</h2>
<p><em>Writer: Brian Wood</em><br />
<em>Art: Garry Brown</em></p>
<p><strong>First Impressions:</strong> Brian Wood is a name that I know, but sadly not one that I’m wholly familiar with. A writer for nearly 20 years and the author of the critically acclaimed <em>DMZ</em> (which I still haven’t read, for shame), Brian wood’s name holds a fair bit of weight. His new series centered around someone called Magnus the Black, and his hunt for the killer of a man under his command, seems to promise a Viking themed tale of revenge. Sounds good to me. Garry Brown has already piqued my interest with a wonderfully sketchy cover that seems to only reinforce the idea of a gritty, hard-wearing tale of revenge. I’ve not taken in a lot of Brian Wood’s work so far, but here’s hoping for a great kick-off point.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> It may be a little early to call it, but I’m just not feeling it. Brian Wood does a good job of setting the scene of a land firmly under the thumb of Christian conversion, and Garry Brown’s art is suitably gritty and harsh; this is no Superman tale of wonder and hope. Equally, the internal monologue of Magnus the Black is appropriately pessimistic and dry. It gives a good sense for the character without wasting too much time and firmly orients the story behind Magnus. The story itself is interesting enough. Magnus is hired to escort a priest up the ‘Black Road’, a road that promises to be full of nothing but death and mayhem. Good stuff. The only problem is that the death of said priest and Magnus joining forces with his adoptive daughter feels a bit rushed. The priest dies and I seriously couldn’t care less. There were the bones for a good story, but it just jumped too suddenly from one thing to another. Perhaps it was a space thing, perhaps it was time; but while the first issue of <em>Black Road</em> is good, it just was not long enough.</p>

<h2>Moon Knight #1 (Marvel)</h2>
<p><em>Writer: Jeff Lemire</em><br />
<em>Artist: Greg Smallwood</em></p>
<p><strong>First Impressions:</strong> Full disclosure right now, I have never subscribed to a single Marvel item in my entire life. I just don’t have the same connection to Marvel as I do DC. Now we have <em>Moon Knight</em>, a new series centered around an old superhero. Jeff Lemire, like Brian Wood, has a name with a some weight. Writing not only a well-received run on <em>Animal Man</em>, a few issues for <em>Futures End</em> and Marvel’s <em>Old Man Logan</em>, Lemire it seems, has the goods. A story about a mystical, insane superhero does seem like it could be a hard one to get into, but I’ve got a good feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The feeling was good, then the feeling was confused. Then the feeling was confused some more. <em>Moon Knight</em> is not a simple, easy to follow story. At this point, I’m still not even 100% sure if the main character actually is Moon Knight himself, or just insane. Opening on an ethereal, Egyptian dreamscape, the story doesn’t begin in a particularly conventional way. What follows is a disjointed, weirdly panelled journey through Marc Spectors time at, what I assume, is an insane asylum. The story does a good job of raising some big questions early on about perception of life, memory and identity; it’s thought provoking without being too stodgy. Jeff Lemire doesn’t allow too much navel gazing, and the moment that Marc Spector dons a bedsheet and lays the beat down on his wardens is very cool. Greg Smallwood also brings out the big guns in terms of art and his use of different styles, panels and layouts really helps build this sense of insanity. On top of that, the use of a white background the entire way through the book ties the whole thing together. From a sheer coolness point of view though, the double page spread of a pyramid in the middle of New York is one of the coolest spreads I’ve seen in a while. <em>Moon Knight</em> is a fantastical tale of insanity, superheroes and magic, has me incredibly intrigued and I’m anxiously waiting for next month.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our word <em>disaster</em> comes from the Greek meaning &#8220;bad star.&#8221; And if one bad star portends calamity, imagine a whole sky of them.</p>
<p>Mayavati doesn&#8217;t have to. She is born with the most malignant horoscope the court has ever seen, and everyone from her father, the Raja, to the lowest girl in the harem knows that Maya is toxic. Her mere presence invites scorn and fearful whispers, and so she stays away, contenting herself with reading and eavesdropping on her father&#8217;s councils. Only her young half-sister Gauri wants anything to do with her, and that&#8217;s fine by Maya. Better a quiet life than a marriage that the stars insist will be cataclysmic.</p>
<p>A wedding is inevitable, though. Her father&#8217;s empire is at war, and she is needed for an alliance. But who, exactly, is the man who presents himself in the midst of bloodshed? And why does he promise her such delights, failing entirely to shrink from her fate like everyone else? What is he hiding, there in his magical kingdom with crystal gardens and empty halls? Maya will have to discover it for herself, and once she does, she&#8217;ll have to decide how far she&#8217;ll go to be with—or without—him.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-37078" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/25203675.jpg" alt="25203675" width="313" height="475" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/25203675.jpg 313w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/25203675-198x300.jpg 198w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/25203675-298x452.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /></p>
<p>While the overall story is a good one, I found certain elements of the plot a bit thin. Maya is supposedly a scholar and savvy political mind. Yet when she&#8217;s asked to give her life for her country (and why she&#8217;s <em>told</em> this I had no idea&#8211;an assassin is far more likely and reasonable), she acquiesces after a single idea&#8211;escape&#8211;fails? I can think of half a dozen alternate solutions, but she accepts her instructions as fate despite a lifetime struggling against the very idea of destiny. And surely someone so well versed in myths and fairy tales would know better than to pursue a mysterious voice and a cold, cold chill in a magical castle&#8211;especially after being warned against such things? It all seems a bit extreme and ill considered, indicating that the Almighty Plot (even when thin) is in charge here, not the characters. The ultimate effect is more like the moment when everyone splits up in a horror movie, and the cheerleader goes down the rickety basement steps. You just <em>know</em> something&#8217;s going to turn out badly. The tension isn&#8217;t so much from empathy with the character at that point, but simply from wondering what exactly is going to befall her&#8211;you&#8217;ve already written her off in your mind. Roshani Chokshi unfortunately falls victim to this trope from time to time, especially since she doesn&#8217;t create the most intuitive or straightforward narrative pacing.</p>
<p>The story rushes ahead and then falls behind, slowing to accommodate a romance but then glossing over critical details of motivation or background in the rush to create action. The prose is incredibly lush all the way through, and sometimes it disguises that unevenness, but not always. Chokshi certainly has a unique and compelling voice, but it needs more direction. Since she&#8217;s a first-time author I&#8217;m confident that she&#8217;ll find it, but in the meantime, her inexperience makes this a bit too bumpy or a bit too smooth.</p>
<p>In particular, the magic is a bit convenient and overpowered, though that does lend dramatic flair to scenes of conflict. It feels a great deal like Rosamund Hodge&#8217;s <em>Cruel Beauty</em>, which also features semi-sentient and dangerous house and a dangerously magical husband. Except that Amar isn&#8217;t all that dangerous. He&#8217;s the perfect gentleman, so much so that only his secrets keep him from feeling bland. Amar is also oddly paternal, taking it upon himself to teach Maya how to act via a series of tests. No matter how respectful he may be, this is not a relationship of equals. Amar has the power. Maya doesn&#8217;t take it from him, she earns it, reinforcing his position as superior for all that she wants to be his equal. To her credit, she eventually realizes this. However, she realizes it with the help of someone who is just as suspect and controlling as Amar. Overall, I don&#8217;t have a terribly favorable impression of Maya&#8217;s choices.</p>
<p>Chokshi shines when writing about the relationships between women. Maya, Gauri, and Mother Dhina are all compellingly portrayed, given depth and strength (except, in Maya&#8217;s case, when she&#8217;s around Amar). Even Kamala, a soulless flesh-eating demon, is a delight! Certain scenes between these ladies are practically sublime, and the setting of medieval/mythic India makes their interactions all the more exquisitely real and archetypally dramatic. They share bitterness and mistakes, and they ultimately find ways of grasping their own power.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I wanted to like this book more than I actually did. It has insight and excellent writing, and some scenes grasp the edges of perfection, so clear and complete that they might be archetypal. But the brilliance isn&#8217;t enough to save it from its own romance and pacing issues. I look forward to reading more from Chokshi, even the loose sequel to <em>The Star-Touched Queen</em> that comes out in a year (I hope it&#8217;s about Gauri).*  But until then, it&#8217;s a good read over a weekend or vacation, but not a great one.</p>
<p><em>The Star-Touched Queen</em> comes out on April 26.</p>
<p>*Edit: it is!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Another short week. Shows seem to be really stretching out this spring season.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blindspot &#8211; Mans Telepathic Loyal Lookouts<img class="size-medium wp-image-37503 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/02_NUP_172582_0491-300x200.jpg" alt="Blindspot" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/02_NUP_172582_0491-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/02_NUP_172582_0491-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/02_NUP_172582_0491-620x414.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/02_NUP_172582_0491.jpg 758w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about Patterson chatting with the crazy imagined version of her dead boyfriend who led her all over the city on a ridiculous scavenger hunt. I think I liked it. Patterson is easily my favorite character. A focus of the story on her and her potential slide into insanity would&#8217;ve been very interesting to see more of. Mostly, I just miss David&#8217;s character. He was the only one capable of doing what the entire FBI can&#8217;t seem to accomplish no-matter how hard they try. What I did enjoy is the shift of the story to characters other than Jane. This might be the first episode in this season that wasn&#8217;t simply about her or a case. The layers of betrayal and depth of story really needed to be here earlier in the season. Overall, this episode wasn&#8217;t just an action-focused adventure and that made it engaging. The ending was satisfying because it resolved a story arc. <em>Blindspot</em> is all about not resolving anything, so bringing a soft conclusion into the show demonstrated that the writers know how to not simply leave plot threads dangling. I very much appreciate this. Ultimately, this episode was typical in that it didn&#8217;t resolve anything or move the primary plot forward. But it did that in a very different way than normal. It also reminded viewers that the point of Jane and her tattoos seems to be revealing not only government conspiracy, but crimes that have been covered up or gone unsolved. The grand purpose is still unclear, and it will almost certainly be far more complicated, but for now it seems to be about making things right. But has anyone else noticed how Jane always ends up shooting whoever is at fault? Maybe she just set herself up to be an executioner.</p>

<div>
<p>This was exactly the right way to end this season. I did not expect anything that happened and I loved every second of both episodes. I&#8217;m very impressed with <em>iZombe</em> right now. This season was slow at times, but did a great job building an exciting story and developing the characters further. This episode had all the best elements of iZombie. It was exciting, dramatic, and funny. It featured some of the best jokes of the entire series. And I was really surprised about how many dramatic deaths the show dished out. I will avoid spoilers, but they were quite intense. i’m a little surprised by who got killed. I wonder if the writers were using this finale to clear the slate of B plots so that season 3 can focus on the main characters and the new developments that they are facing. I’m really going to miss some of the characters that are now dead. I don’t want to spoil anything, but they had a huge impact on the show. But they had also been around for an entire season and their story arcs were getting a little stagnant. I’m going to miss some of the interactions that these characters provided. However, by this point, the writers have earned my trust that the next season will not be a lower quality for this loss. Blaine was a bit confusing this episode. I like the new version of Blaine. But I don&#8217;t know where this version of run around shooting people Blaine came from. I don&#8217;t dislike it at all. I still don&#8217;t like Boss. He&#8217;s been underused since the beginning, but he&#8217;s always been a factor in the story. The character feels like he should&#8217;ve been far more important. Obviously, Blaine was a bigger part of the story when it comes to the drugs that mixed with the energy drink that created zombies (that&#8217;s still weird to say) but Boss seems like he should&#8217;ve been more involved. He was established early on as a criminal mastermind that owned most of the city, but his appearances were usually a punchline or a &#8220;shocking twist&#8221; type thing. I have a feeling that he will continue to have less importance to the story as season 3 develops. As a finale, these episodes made me excited for the next season. They wrapped up a few plot points but keep the story  moving forward. This was a terrific end to an above average second season of <em>iZombie</em>.</p>

Hey, that coin finally got explained. And singing Lucifer, which is the only Lucifer that I care about, showed up. The rest of the story was dull and pointless. Until the ending. Which of course wasn&#8217;t explained and only repeated the facts from earlier episodes. So either the writers forgot what they had already done (which wouldn&#8217;t be surprising) or they decided repeating details was the only way to get the pitiful excuse for a story back on track. The fact that Decker somehow makes Lucifer mortal was always obvious. If this show could do anything beyond wallow in lame weekly criminals of the week and procedural drama, it would move forward with this story. Instead, it was forgotten for, what, nine or ten episodes? If the rest of the show was good enough to support the lack of this mystery, it would be fine. But everything else is boring. Nothing that has happened makes me care about Decker&#8217;s ex, the other cop dude, or angels boning. However. Lucifer is not the worst show on television. It&#8217;s just not great. I never expected it to be anything more than this. The problem is that <em>Lucifer</em> is trying to be both a procedural cop show and a supernatural genre show. It&#8217;s rubbish compared to other supernatural genre shows, but it&#8217;s not bad compared to other procedural cop shows. And for as much as I dislike it, I still want to know what happens. So maybe it&#8217;s not really that bad.</p>

If nothing else, this episode reminded me why I love Bullock and only Bullock in all of <em>Gotham</em>. Everything else was pretty bad. Opening the episode with Bruce and Selena making an impossible jump and then jamming exposition down the viewer&#8217;s throats was just stupid. Plus, no-one wants to see Selena&#8217;s stupid goggles over her stupid hat. That stitching on the jacket was an obvious nod to the <em>Batman Returns</em> Catwoman. This was one of the few good easter eggs in the show. The kids are the worst part of the show. Well. Maybe slightly better not than the atrocious CG. Gordon easily breaking into IA after saying how hard it was and then getting an actual reel to reel tape recording was even worse. The technology in Gotham has no logical existence. Look at Nygma&#8217;s apartment. He&#8217;s got old-fashioned neon and recording equipment, but fancy modern stainless steel kitchen equipment. And speaking of Nygma, why did Gordon say that he worked on audio files? That&#8217;s never been an element of the show. The development with Penguin might be the most cruel thing the show has ever done. Why did they feel the need to justify the resurgence of his criminal insanity with insultingly horrible treatment from horrible people? This creates an excuse for his actions, which weakens the character that&#8217;s been building this entire time. Penguin as a criminal who&#8217;s fought his way through the ranks was interesting. Penguin as a criminal who threw a temper tantrum and went cannibalistically crazy is a cartoon. Also, he randomly killed a dog. Bad form. Also, how does an open glass bottle of booze stay in a drawer and somehow not spill? The return to the Wayne murder feels like a desperate effort of the writers to say &#8220;see, we still know what this show is about!&#8221; It&#8217;s too little too late. I was wondering if the whole &#8220;Thomas Wayne had a secret lair with a secret computer&#8221; thing would come back. And Alfred said Fox fixed if a few days ago. Didn&#8217;t that happen at the start of this season? See, I can&#8217;t remember because <em>Gotham</em> ignores characters and plot arcs until it needs them instead of actually telling a story and resolving anything. I wonder how long it will be until the show reveals that Thomas was a costumed crime fighter. And yet again, this episodes demonstrates that no consequence or situation in <em>Gotham</em> lasts for more than a single episode.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Legends of Tomorrow &#8211; The Magnificent Eight<img class="size-medium wp-image-37507 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legends-of-Tomorrow-The-Magnificent-Eight-300x169.jpg" alt="Legends-of-Tomorrow-The-Magnificent-Eight" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legends-of-Tomorrow-The-Magnificent-Eight-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legends-of-Tomorrow-The-Magnificent-Eight.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legends-of-Tomorrow-The-Magnificent-Eight-298x168.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
I don&#8217;t know where to start first. The cowboy cosplay? How fun it was to watch the team geeking out in the Wild West and just having fun? How good Sara looks in a hat and duster? That bar fight? The random exposition that not only explained Rip&#8217;s constant failure but made Rory an important part of the plot again? Or how a show on the CW trumped the major motion picture depiction of Jonah Hex? This might  be one of the best episodes of Legends in this season. It&#8217;s got the right balance of humor and action. It&#8217;s not plagued with the often problematic plot. It uses, enjoys, and highlights  every bit of the time travel and Wild West tropes with no hesitation, straight down to the &#8220;inspiring the young version of a famous dude&#8221; bit. The only part of this episode that I did not enjoy was the two Kendras. It was pure exposition and it wasn&#8217;t handled very well. Maybe this is just me, though. I&#8217;ve said before that I don&#8217;t really enjoy the Hawks and Savage connection, and that I don&#8217;t like Kendra being the focus of this season. Not that it&#8217;s a bad concept or that she&#8217;s a bad actress or character. It&#8217;s just not being handled well compared to other parts of the show. So with that in mind, yeah, I didn&#8217;t like this part. But for someone who is engaged in this aspect of the story, it was actually pretty good. What surprised me most is how brutal that last big fight was. I&#8217;m surprised that the team slaughtered the bad guys, who in all honesty weren&#8217;t really bad guys, so willingly. As to the Pilgrim element, it&#8217;s totally predictable. There always has to be another bigger and badder opponent for the heroes to deal with. I&#8217;d be happy with a lot more of this type of quality from <em>Legends</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOUSE TYRELL</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-37461" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-house-tyrell-wallpaper-e1461080291509-300x210.jpg" alt="game-of-thrones-house-tyrell-wallpaper" width="726" height="508" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-house-tyrell-wallpaper-e1461080291509-300x210.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-house-tyrell-wallpaper-e1461080291509-768x538.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-house-tyrell-wallpaper-e1461080291509-1200x840.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-house-tyrell-wallpaper-e1461080291509-298x209.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-house-tyrell-wallpaper-e1461080291509-620x434.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-house-tyrell-wallpaper-e1461080291509.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Mace</strong> is still such a doof. After Tywin&#8217;s death, he puts himself up for the position of Hand of the King but Cersei appoints him the joint Master of Ships and Coin. At a Small Council meeting, he tells the rest that the Iron Bank has called in 1/10th of the Crown&#8217;s debts but the Crown can&#8217;t even pay half of whats being demanded. Yeeesh. Mace is more than happy to lend the Crown the money but Cersei tells him to chill. She tasks him with going to Braavos and negotiating better terms with the Iron Bank &#8211; me thinks she&#8217;s just sending him to Braavos to annoy someone else, which he does. Tycho Nestoris HATES Mace.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Margaery</strong> married Tommen and, consequently, dug herself deeper in the &#8220;my enemies&#8221; list Cersei keeps in her heart because Margaery couldn&#8217;t help but rub her new marriage, queenship, and sex life (with Cersei&#8217;s son) in Cersei&#8217;s face. After Loras is arrested by the Faith Militant, Margaery tries to get Tommen to spring him but Tommen is helpless. He also doesn&#8217;t think his mother had anything to do with Loras&#8217; arrest but Margaery knows better. She, of course, writes to Olenna about Loras&#8217; arrest. She also testifies on behalf of her brother but Loras&#8217; secret lovah, Olyvar, gives testimony against him, which leads to Margaery also being arrested for giving false testimony. Cersei visits Margaery in her cell but Margaery is definitely NOT in the mood for her shit and tells her to leave. We leave Margaery knowing that she will stand trial, along with her brother.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Loras </strong>literally gives no fucks &#8211; he is no longer careful about having his boyfie visit his chamber, which annoys Margaery. But maybe he should&#8217;ve listened to his sister because he is arrested by Crazy Lancel and his crazy friends/fellow Faith Militants. At his holy inquest, Loras denies the allegations against him and his alleged relationship with Renly. His sister testifies for him but then his boyfie (ex boyfie now, I guess) fucks up everything. Now, both he and his sister await a full trial before the Gods.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-37462 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GOTep7a_3317784b-300x187.jpg" alt="Episode 7 &quot;The Gift&quot;. Rigg, Diana as Olenna Tyrell" width="726" height="453" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GOTep7a_3317784b-300x187.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GOTep7a_3317784b-298x186.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GOTep7a_3317784b.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Olenna</strong>&#8216;s grandbabies are in religion jail and she is HEATED. She has a conversation with Cersei, wherein she tells Cersei that while she and Tywin didn&#8217;t like each other, they still understood the need for rivals to team up at times, which might also be now since the Reach provided for so much of the food for King&#8217;s Landing. Cersei is Cersei and tells Olenna that the Lannisters have no rivals. At Loras&#8217; inquest, she helplessly watches as her grandbabies are both arrested. This just will not do! She meets with the High Sparrow, who she tries to bribe and then threaten to get him to release Loras and Margaery, but he is unmoved. She then meets with Petyr Baelish, who denies any involvement in Loras&#8217; arrest. When Olenna warns about revealing Petyr and her joint involvement in Joff&#8217;s death, Petyr gives Olenna the same thing he gave Cersei &#8211; a handsome young man &#8211; but in this instance, it is little Lancel, who eventually confesses to the affair he had with Cersei.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOUSE MARTELL</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-37464" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/martell_sigil_wallpaper_by_mortaris-d5cu2c4-300x189.jpg" alt="martell_sigil_wallpaper_by_mortaris-d5cu2c4" width="726" height="457" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/martell_sigil_wallpaper_by_mortaris-d5cu2c4-300x189.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/martell_sigil_wallpaper_by_mortaris-d5cu2c4-768x485.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/martell_sigil_wallpaper_by_mortaris-d5cu2c4-298x188.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/martell_sigil_wallpaper_by_mortaris-d5cu2c4-620x391.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/martell_sigil_wallpaper_by_mortaris-d5cu2c4.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Prince <strong>Doran</strong> is sad because he lost his brother, Oberyn, but Ellaria and the Sand Snakes aren&#8217;t making it easy for him. Ellaria accuses him of being weak and not seeking revenge for Oberyn&#8217;s murder but, since he died fighting in a trial by combat, Doran doesn&#8217;t consider his death to be murder. Ellaria really wants to harm Myrcella but Doran prohibits it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37465 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Meeting_in_dorn_jaime_myrcella-300x180.jpg" alt="Meeting_in_dorn_jaime_myrcella" width="727" height="436" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Meeting_in_dorn_jaime_myrcella-300x180.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Meeting_in_dorn_jaime_myrcella-768x461.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Meeting_in_dorn_jaime_myrcella-1200x720.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Meeting_in_dorn_jaime_myrcella-298x179.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Meeting_in_dorn_jaime_myrcella-620x372.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Jamie Lannister&#8217;s arrival in Dorne is sudden and unexpected. Once found out, Doran invites Jaime to eat with him and asks Jaime why he felt the need to sneak into Dorne. Jaime tells him about threatening message Cersei received -the snake with Myrcella&#8217;s necklace. Doran knows it was Ellaria&#8217;s doing and reassures Jaime that no harm will come to Jaime and Myrcella. He offers to send Myrcella back to Kings Landing but only if she can be accompanied by Trystane, who is to also be given Oberyn&#8217;s seat on the Small Council. Doran later admonishes Ellaria for her behavior and offers to grant her mercy if she swears loyalty to him, which she tearfully does. He sees Myrcella &amp; Co. off but is unaware of Ellaria&#8217;s poison coated kiss to Myrcella. Betrayed again. Remember, he believes in second chances but not third ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37529 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Sand-Snakes-300x169.jpg" alt="The-Sand-Snakes" width="728" height="410" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Sand-Snakes-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Sand-Snakes-768x431.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Sand-Snakes-1200x674.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Sand-Snakes-298x167.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Sand-Snakes-620x348.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Sand-Snakes.jpg 1278w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ellaria and the Sand Snakes</strong> really really really want revenge for Oberyn&#8217;s death and they&#8217;re okay with hurting Myrcella for it. Ellaria thinks Doran is weak for not raising up and army to seek revenge, but Doran has seen war and does not want to bring that to his people again. Plus he doesn&#8217;t think Oberyn&#8217;s death was murder. The Sand Snakes have the merchant who smuggled Jaime and Bronn to Dorne, so they know Jaime is coming to take Myrcella home &#8211; they have to act quickly. Obara, Nymeria, and Tyene all declare their loyalty to Ellaria instead of Doran. They make their way back to the Water Garden to kidnap Myrcella but are thwarted by the palace guards, led by Aero Hotah, and imprisoned for treachery.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone" src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/5163bd4cdf733eafe4a1b8783aa3bccb/tumblr_npyvvsZTHW1qz72sno2_r1_500.gif" alt="" width="726" height="408" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ellaria is asked to join Doran, Jaime, Myrcella, and Trystane for drinks and food, where she is less than civil to Doran and Jaime. She is rude as heck, which prompts Doran to threaten her with her life if she ever speaks to him that way again. Later, Doran gives Ellaria an ultimatum: pledge him loyalty or die and she tearfully complies. She goes to speak with Jaime and makes up for being rude earlier, implying that she knows Myrcella is his daughter and not his niece. At Jaime and Myrcella&#8217;s send off, Ellaria kisses Myrcella goodbye on the lips. As they watch them sail off, blood trickles down Ellaria&#8217;s nose and she takes the antidote to the poison she had coated on her lips to kill Myrcella. Doran is going to be pissed, especially because now Trystane&#8217;s life is in danger.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">UGH <strong>Dany</strong>. Can I just skip her? No? OKAY FINE!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She&#8217;s mad that things aren&#8217;t going her way and people won&#8217;t do what she wants them to do. SHE&#8217;S QUEEN, DAMNIT! The Sons of the Harpy are creating chaos and murdering people, so she has the Unsullied to patrol the streets of Mereen. Hizdahr keeps trying to get her to open the fighting pits because tradition and stuff, but Dany doesn&#8217;t budge. Daario tries to get her to reconsider with his buns-o-steel, but she&#8217;s unmoved. Drogon hasn&#8217;t been seen in weeks and, when she goes to visit Rahegal and Viserion, they try to attack her. TBH, if my mom locked me up in the dungeons and then tried to visit me like nothing was wrong, I&#8217;d do the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37468 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-season-5-gallery-59-300x200.jpg" alt="game-of-thrones-season-5-gallery-59" width="724" height="482" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-season-5-gallery-59-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-season-5-gallery-59.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-season-5-gallery-59-298x198.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Daario and Grey Worm find a Son of the Harpy hiding and Dany, along with her advisers, debate about what must be done with the dude. Barristan says the man deserves a free trial but the freed slave on the council, Mossador, insists that he should be put to death. After the meeting, Barristan tells Dany about her father, the Mad King, and how terrible and cruel he was; how he gave people the &#8220;justice&#8221; he thought they deserved, which ultimately led to the uprising and left all Targaryens, except Dany and Viserys, dead. Dany says she&#8217;s not like her father and promises to give the man a fair trial, but Mossador executes him without Dany&#8217;s permission. So, Dany has Mossador publicly executed after giving a spiel about how freedom and justice need to coexist. His execution riles up the people and a riot breaks out. GREAT JOB, DANY.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She has a really sweet and poignant conversation with Barristan, after which, she gives him the day off. He&#8217;s strolling the streets when he comes upon the Unsullied being attacked by so many Sons of the Harpy. He joins the fight but is killed in the battle. Sad/mad about Barry&#8217;s death, she takes the leaders of Meereen&#8217;s noble houses and takes them down to the dungeons where her two dragons are kept &#8211; to scare them into telling her who is colluding with the Sons of the Harpy. One of the leaders is killed by the dragons and she imprisons the rest of them. Taking Missandei&#8217;s advice, she visits Hizdahr and admits her mistake in not re-opening the fighting pits. She is also going to marry Hizdahr to bind herself to the noble people of Meereen, strengthening her rule over Meereen.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">At the fighting pits, Dany is visibly uncomfortable with the savagery but stays after being convinced to do so by her new husbando. There&#8217;s a new fighter and he&#8217;s super good. After the fight it over, the new fighter is revealed to be Jorah &#8211; whaaaaaat?! He has a gift for Dany: Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion talks her out of executing Jorah and has him banished from Meereen instead. She and Tyrion talk about what she should do: Tyrion advises her to build a new kingdom where she is but Dany ain&#8217;t about that life. She is going to Westeros and she will conquer it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzA2LzA4LzgwL2RyYWdvbjEuNTYyYWIuZ2lmCnAJdGh1bWIJODUweDg1MD4KZQlqcGc/214e6e55/a7b/dragon1.jpg" alt="" width="725" height="414" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They go to another fighting pit and Jorah is again the last fighter standing. He suddenly hurls a spear at the royal box and you think he&#8217;s so mad at Dany that he&#8217;s trying to kill her, but he&#8217;s really trying to murder the Son of the Harpy who has snuck into the royal box to murder Dany. Then, all hell breaks loose. The Sons of the Harpy reveal themselves on every level of the arena and start straight up murdering everyone, including Hizdahr. Jorah and Daario manage to get Dany down to the fighting pit and Tyrion helps Missandei escape. In the pit, they are surrounded and outnumbered by the Sons of the Harpy &#8211; it is clear to Dany that they will die here so she holds Missandei&#8217;s hand and closes her eyes, ready for death. But hold up sister &#8211; whats that noise? It&#8217;s yo dragon-son, Drogon! While Drogon is biting and burning them, the Sons of the Harpy try to attack him with spears. Dany climbs on to Drogon&#8217;s back and tells him to fly, and they take off into a terrible<em> Neverending Story</em> CGI. They stop far far away from Meereen, in the middle of green grassland. Drogon is hurt and is not into flying anymore. While Dany tries to find food, she sees Dothraki bloodriders. While the whole khalasar surrounds her, she drops her ring to leave a trail.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">If you were a teenage King and a HOT older lady, who used to be your terrible brother&#8217;s wife, flirts with you, what would you do? Marry her, duh! <strong>Tommen</strong> really likes Margaery and realllllly likes sexing her. He&#8217;s totes getting played by her but who cares, she&#8217;s HOT. He is caught between a rock and a hard place though, with his mother on one side and his Marg on the other. Then his wife gets arrested for false testimony and, even though he&#8217;s the King, he can&#8217;t get her out. UGHHHHHHH.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-37472" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jaime-and-Myrcella-S05E10-300x169.jpg" alt="Jaime-and-Myrcella-S05E10" width="726" height="409" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jaime-and-Myrcella-S05E10-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jaime-and-Myrcella-S05E10-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jaime-and-Myrcella-S05E10-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jaime-and-Myrcella-S05E10-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jaime-and-Myrcella-S05E10-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Myrcella</strong> is so in love with her betrothed, Trystane. They make the cutest couple. They&#8217;re just strolling the gardens, being lovey-dovey when her Uncle-Dad springs out of nowhere to take her back. Uncle-Dads can be so unfair sometimes. She&#8217;s not into going back to Kings Landing; this is where she lives now. She&#8217;s okay with Doran&#8217;s plan to have her return to Kings Landing escorted by her fiance. At the farewell, Ellaria kisses her goodbye on the lips. On the boat, she tells Jaime that she knows about Cersei and Jaime and they hug it out, which is a sweet scene. But then her nose starts bleeding, and she dies. Ellaria got her with the ol&#8217; poison-on-the-lips trick.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="wp-image-37486 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Cersei_3322325b-300x187.jpg" alt="Cersei_3322325b" width="727" height="453" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Cersei_3322325b-300x187.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Cersei_3322325b-298x186.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Cersei_3322325b.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Cersei</strong> is ice cold to everyone at Tywin&#8217;s funeral, including Jaime, who she partially blames for their father&#8217;s death. She is <em>not</em> amused by Margaery and Tommen&#8217;s budding romance. Lancel has joined the Sparrows and is now crazy religious &#8211; he asks for her forgiveness because of their &#8220;relationship&#8221; and for serving Robert the wine that led to his death. Cersei says &#8220;ok whatever&#8221; and keeps going. Later, she shows Jaime a box she has received, containing a red viper with Myrcella&#8217;s necklace &#8211; she is pissed. Its clearing a threat from Dorne for Oberyn&#8217;s death. Jaime promises to go to Dorne and bring back Myrcella. She is still looking for Tyrion and has promised a lordship to anyone who brings her his head, which means a lot of dwarves who are <em>not </em>Tyrion are getting straight murdered. She&#8217;s apparently just donating these heads to Qyburn&#8217;s experiments. Cool. At the Small Council meeting, which is not attended by Tommen, she tries to appoint her Uncle Kevan as Master of War but he refuses to be her puppet and returns to Casterly Rock instead. She tries to turn a besotted Tommen against his new bride but he asks her how she would like to return to Casterly Rock instead. Unnerved by this, she goes to confront Margaery but loses in the passive aggressiveness battle because Margaery is on top of her backhanded compliment game.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">She makes an &#8220;alliance&#8221; with the High Sparrow and throws the High Septon (who had been paraded through the streets naked for having been caught in a brothel) into the black cells. She later names the High Sparrow as the new High Septon. She clearly thinks doing this will mean she will have the High Sparrow&#8217;s loyalty &#8211; oh sweet summer child. After Loras&#8217; arrest, Tommen asks her if she had anything to do with it and she says no. She meets with Petyr Baelish, who divulges Sansa&#8217;s whereabouts to her, saying once Stannis&#8217; army fight the Bolton&#8217;s, he would get the army of Vale to finish off the winner; all he wants in exchange is to be named the Warden of the North and Cersei is okay with that.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">After Margaery is imprisoned for giving false testimony, Tommen is hella depressed and Cersei tries to make him feel better by tell him she will burn everything to the ground if it meant protecting him. Nothing like a warm fuzzy story. She visits Margaery, who does not want to see her. She then visits the High Sparrow, who informs her that Loras and Margaery are to both face a full trial and that their falsehoods will be revealed, as is everyone&#8217;s, including Cersei &#8211; apparently Lancel done confessed his sins, y&#8217;all. Cersei is taken to a cell and imprisoned, but not before she threatens to kill them all for what they are doing to her. While in custody, Cersei is having a rough time &#8211; the septas withhold water until she confesses and although she seems stoic at first, like she doesn&#8217;t need water to survive, but after refusing to confess, she  licks the poured out water off of the floor. Qyburn visits her with news from the Red Keep: Tommen is in deep depression, Pycelle has summoned Kevan from Casterly Rock, and Qyburn&#8217;s experiment is progressing. Cersei finally breaks down and confesses to the High Sparrow but only admits to adultery with Lancel and not incest with Jaime, which, if Lancel is her cousin, wouldn&#8217;t it still be considered incest? Anyway, as her trial, she is stripped naked, with her hair shorn off, and made to walk through the city streets to the Red Keep. She tries to keep her head high but it is a terrible form of punishment; people are yelling insults at her and pelting her with rocks and gross stuff. Bloodied and bruised, she finally makes it to the Red Keep, where Kevan, Pycelle, and Qyburn are waiting for her. Qyburn introduces to their newest Kingsguard, Frankengregor, who carries her away to have her wounds looked at.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Jaime</strong> kind of feels guilty about Tywin&#8217;s death, after all, he helped Tyrion escape, who ended up killing Tywin. Cersei summons him to show him a gift she received, clearly as a threat from Dorne. She is livid and, in order to calm her down, he promises to go to Dorne himself and bring Myrcella back. He goes to Castle Stokeworth to recruit his old buddy Bronn to join him on his trip. In Dorne, they best some Dornish soldiers and don their clothes to sneak into the castle. At the Water Gardens, they surprise Myrcella and Trystane and Jaime tries to convince Myrcella to leave with him, but they are themselves surprised by the Sand Snakes. After a small skirmish, Aero Hotah breaks up the party and Jaime is imprisoned in a nice cell, while Bronn is taken to the actual cells. Myrcella is allowed to visit her Uncle-Dad, and Jaime urges Myrcella to leave with him, which she refuses. Girl is in love. Jaime later meets with Doran, who asks him why he snuck into Dorne to abduct Myrcella, so Jaime explains the whole threatening box thing. Doran offers to let Jaime take Myrcella back if the engagement can still stand, Trystane can go with them, and take Oberyn&#8217;s seat on the Small Council. Jaime agrees to these terms. After they bid Dorne farewell, on the boat, Jaime talks to Myrcella, who tells him she knows about Cersei and him. She tells him she&#8217;s glad that he is her real father and they hug. But then her nose starts bleeding, she collapses, and dies in his arms.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tyrion</strong> is in Pentos, at the house of Illyrio Mopathis, where Varys is trying to persuade him to help restore House Targaryen to the Iron Throne but all Tyrion wants to do is DRINK. They talk more, discussing the kind of leader that the Seven Kingdoms needs, until Varys tells Tyrion he can either drink himself to death or go to Meereen and meet Dany, to which Tyrion agrees. They have to travel to Meereen in a carriage though and be hidden, because of the bounty that Cersei has placed on Tyrion&#8217;s head. Having had enough of the carriage, Tyrion opts to walk to Volantis, accompanied by a reluctant Varys. They visit a brothel, where they meet a woman dressed up as Dany. After Tyrion talks to a prostitute, he goes outside to relieve himself but is caught and abducted by Jorah, who is going to take Tyrion to &#8220;the Queen&#8221; &#8211; Dany.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Gagged and bound, Tyrion annoys Jorah enough to get him to remove his gag. Tyrion is very perceptive and guesses who he is, that he was banished by Dany, and that he is hoping to get back in Dany&#8217;s good graces by bringing her Tyrion. While sailing through Old Valyria, they notice Drogon flying overhead and then get attacked by Stonemen. Tyrion is dragged under water by one of them but he is rescued by Jorah and both of them make it shore. Both seem to have gotten away unharmed but, unbeknownst to Tyrion, Jorah has been infected with greyscale. As they make their way to Meereen by foot, they are both captured by slavers but Tyrion convinces them to put Jorah into the fighting pits since he is a famous Westerosi fighter. When they reach the outskirts of Meereen, Jorah is sold to Yezzan zo Qaggaz, whom Tyrion tries to convince to buy him also, by beating his handler with his own chain. Yezzan relents and takes his slaves to the fighting pits, where Jorah enlists to fight as soon as he hears that Dany is in attendance. After Jorah wins, he presents Tyrion to Dany as his gift.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37491 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/images-300x150.jpg" alt="images" width="728" height="364" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/images-300x150.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/images-298x149.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/images.jpg 318w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dany wants to execute Tyrion as revenge but he tells her that he killed both his mother and father, so killing him won&#8217;t really be revenge. Dany then asks what she should do with Jorah and Tyrion talks her into banishing him once again instead of executing him. Dany decides to take Tyrion on as her adviser on how to conquer the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion tries to tell her that she would be better off establishing a new kingdom in Essos but she&#8217;s not having it &#8211; she will conquer Westeros. Dany has always been very idealistic in thinking that the common people will support her &#8211; Tyrion tells her all that sounds great when you say it but questions how she intends to win the Seven Kingdoms where maybe one great house will support her claim, if she&#8217;s having such a hard time controlling the chaos in Meereen. Her answer: she isn&#8217;t trying to stop the wheel, she will break it &#8211; whatever that means. More of her grand talks with no real actions to support it, me thinks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the Great Games in Daznak&#8217;s Pit, Tyrion is in the Royal box along with Dany, Missandei, Daario, and Hizdahr. Jorah wins the game and then the Sons of the Harpy attack. Tyrion helps Missandei and they both manage to get down to the fighting pit along with Daario and Dany. Surrounded by the Sons of the Harpy, they are &#8220;helped&#8221; by Drogon, who flies down and starts chomping and burning the Sons of the Harpy. Dany gets on Drogon&#8217;s back and they take off.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-37492 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tyrion-varys-meereen-300x169.png" alt="Tyrion-varys-meereen" width="726" height="409" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tyrion-varys-meereen-300x169.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tyrion-varys-meereen-768x432.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tyrion-varys-meereen-1200x675.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tyrion-varys-meereen-298x168.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tyrion-varys-meereen-620x349.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tyrion-varys-meereen.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the wake of Dany&#8217;s departure, they try to figure out what to do. Tyrion surmises that Drogon flew north and that they should follow. After a quick argument with Jorah, Daario convinces both that he and Jorah should follow Drogon&#8217;s path and try to find Dany, while Tyrion stays behind and manages things in Meereen. Later, Tyrion is joined by Varys as they watch Jorah and Daario leave.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, a Daimon was defeated, Sailors Uranus and Neptune issued ominous warnings but otherwise did zilch, and Hotaru healed Chibi-Usa by the laying on of hand. Today, we get the reaction. Which is shock and awe, obviously, because eight year old consumptives (it’s not clear what Hotaru’s malady is so I’m going to refer to it as consumption, which if you think about it is probably not that far off) don’t usually glow and stitch you up. Hotaru’s own response is to be embarrassed, because she thinks it’s “creepy.”</p>
<div id="attachment_37524" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-37524" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.20.25-AM.png" alt="Pictured: pink polka dots are creeeepy" width="1280" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.20.25-AM.png 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.20.25-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.20.25-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.20.25-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.20.25-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.20.25-AM-620x388.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pictured: pink polka dots are creeeepy</p></div>
<p>My first reaction on learning that a girl could heal wounds with a touch would not be “creepy!” Maybe “how has the government not carted you off to experiment on you?” or “why are you not leading a cult?” but definitely not “creepy.” Although it <em>is</em> creepy that she just admits she has this power in front of everyone. Isn’t that a little…dangerous? I guess the Sailor Guardians who have been protecting Tokyo for two years aren’t really a threat. I kind of wish we had more of a sense of the public reaction to them—are they superheroes? They certainly protect their identities, all of them except Chibi-Usa, who kind of lets slip who and what she is right off the bat.</p>
<p>But secrets are mutually assured destruction, so I guess they all agree to let the matter rest. The Inners go back to base and debate her briefly, Chibi-Usa blushing all the while. Chibi-Usa has certainly inherited her mother’s tendency to crush on hot young ladies at the drop of a hat. (See what I did there?)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37522" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.22.31-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-20 at 8.22.31 AM" width="1280" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.22.31-AM.png 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.22.31-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.22.31-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.22.31-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.22.31-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.22.31-AM-620x388.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>They then move on to the two mysterious new guardians/enemies. Inner Senshi certainly don’t think very highly of the Outers, suspecting them of being enemies in clever disguises. Those disguises must be <em>really good</em> because somehow, despite identical builds and hair, the Senshi aren’t able to link them to the vaguely threatening Hotaru and Michiru. A+ detectives we’ve got here.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37520" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.21-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-20 at 8.25.21 AM" width="1280" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.21-AM.png 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.21-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.21-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.21-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.21-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.21-AM-620x388.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Meanwhile in Mugen Academy, Hotaru gets upset with Kaolinite, whom she suspects of trying to get with her dad (not incorrectly). Kaolinite and Professor Tomoe basically shrug at her distress, both physical and emotional, and let her run off. Professor Tomoe does at least go to find her in bed later, and gives her a mysterious crystal to stop her from shivering with pain. The crystal is, of course, completely evil and probably a link to Pharaoh 90, but I for one am glad that Hotaru is not in agony or fever-sweating anymore.</p>
<p>Oh, right, Taioron crystal, which, sure. Let’s get a focus for all this evil. Yes, it’s kind of the same as the black crystals from last season, and the crystal-named henchmen of Queen Beryl, but they’ve clearly got something that works.</p>
<p>Kaolinite uses her crystal to do a bit of divination, and sees three lights with telltale colors appear, turquoise, yellow, and violet. Something whispers to her about three talismans before the lights shine too brightly and physically repel her. Powerful stuff. (Also, three lights? Really? Never mind that there are four Outer Senshi—I guess someone really wanted to reference Super S and the Starlights. Does this mean we <em>are</em> or <em>aren’t</em> getting a fourth season?)</p>

Right?</p></div>
<p>Mamoru also has premonitions about three talismans, as does Michiru, as does Rei. Something’s awakening! Everyone needs to collect talismans! And levels! This is an anime by way of a video game!</p>
<p>More usefully, Usagi correctly deduces the connection between the mysterious new Sailor Senshi and Haruka and Michiru. This is only sort of useful because she immediately doubts herself, but I gotta give credit to the writers, this is exactly the kind of high WIS, low INT kind of intuitive leap that Usagi should be good at. Regardless of her level of conviction, the other Senshi do think Haruka’s bad news, and try to shoo him (her)* off. All except Rei, who is absent.</p>
<p>It turns out that Rei is off purifying herself in the mountains somewhere, even though Mako wants to plan her a party. What crazy hijinks! Not that I don’t appreciate their attempt at small talk and the friendly humor that made the original so endearing, but they haven’t quite nailed “humor” or “friendship” here. It’s all al little awkward. Still, I’m glad they have a reasonable excuse to tromp up the mountain to interrupt a sacred retreat. With cake! And the retreat is only mostly sacred. It’s also an excuse to spy on Mugen’s retreat for new students and pick up their vibes.</p>
<p>Rei has a vision about the talismans, and wonders “is that a keyword to bring destruction on our enemies?” Yes, she actually use the English “keyword.” I do not think that means what you think it means! She also&#8230;doesn&#8217;t know what the word destruction means?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37518" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.26.50-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-20 at 8.26.50 AM" width="1280" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.26.50-AM.png 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.26.50-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.26.50-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.26.50-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.26.50-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.26.50-AM-620x388.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Fortunately, Rei is cannier than her vocabulary suggests, and she’s keeping an eye on a training camp for Mugen students. Including Haruka, who’s apparently awesome at judo in addition to being awesome at racing cars, piloting choppers, and running. Haruka defeats Jupiter in a match and while this establishes that the Outers are probably more powerful than the Inners, I&#8217;m not sure what else this interlude does.</p>
<p>We finally get to the heart of matters that night. Mugen, looking extremely like a cult, has a giant nighttime bonfire and reads out the school rules, which are all about doing well in school, achieving their academic potential, and becoming unholy vessels for a power from beyond the stars. Pretty standard stuff. But when’s the booze-related hazing?</p>

<p>Mars and Jupiter, disappointed by the lack of cheap beer (and presence of pure evil or whatever), disrupt the gathering. Eudial goes on about being level 78 and wanting to raise her level, which if there’s a cult that will let me (a) treat life like a video game and (b) shoot fireballs, I am 100% in. Sorry, family and friends! It was nice knowing you.</p>

<p>Another well-animated battle ensues in which Mercury and Jupiter get their asses handed to them. In their defense, fighting fire with fire (and lightning) is a <em>terrible idea</em>. Fortunately, the genius Ami comes and uses water. Yes, IQ of 300, thank you Ami-chan. She gives the assist to Usagi, who unleases her Moon Spiral Heart Attack and hits Eudial right in the points.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37515" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.30.31-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-20 at 8.30.31 AM" width="1280" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.30.31-AM.png 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.30.31-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.30.31-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.30.31-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.30.31-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.30.31-AM-620x388.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>And Eudial’s…gone? Already? Ugh. So not only are they doing the same damn thing as last season, turning the Ayakashi sisters into mirrors for the Senshi in terms of their powers, they’re continuing this distressing trend of killing people rather than saving them. Original Sailor Moon was very careful to ensure that only androids, card-projections, weird pseudo-eggs, and the like were killed—the people they took over weren’t harmed, and the instigators were eventually reformed. So why this shift to the more violent and less interesting destruction? I harp on this, but I think it’s important. This show was, at its heart, a hopeful meditation on the ability of kindness and friendship to literally reform the galaxy. They’ve traded that philosophy for some fight scenes and the cheap thrill of another mini-boss defeated.</p>

<p>Their choice to make the Sailors, especially Sailor Moon, more powerful is another one I’m not totally sold on. Yes, it’s nice to see the sailors at a disadvantage but still holding their own. Yes, the battles are well done. Yes, we only have a few episodes as opposed to 200 to tell this story, and character growth from weakness to strength takes time. These are all legit, but this story is about the growth of young women into adulthood, moving from weakness to strength, and I miss the embrace of weakness. Sailor Moon was never the strongest badass. What made her unstoppable was not her attacks, it was her purely good heart, her loyal friends, and her refusal to ever give up. I just want a little more of that, please.</p>
<p>But anyway, the Outers have been watching the battle, and they hoof it again when it’s over. Sailor Moon pursues them this time, and eventually catches up to Sailor Uranus. Sailor Uranus warns her away yet again, and then, rather incongruously and non-monogamously, smooches her right on the lips. Whoa whoa whoa, wait a minute, that’s the end of the episode?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37513" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.18.13-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-20 at 8.18.13 AM" width="1280" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.18.13-AM.png 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.18.13-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.18.13-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.18.13-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.18.13-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.18.13-AM-620x388.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>I’m not terribly pleased at this shocker. Uranus and Neptune were always kinda flirty with other people, but they were deeply in love with each other first and foremost. And even if they accept non-monogamy here, it’s still not okay to go around kissing other people out of the blue! Usagi has only ever kissed Mamoru, and she’s pretty upset! The lack of consent here is uncomfortable at best, and I am pretty disappointed that they use this cliffhanger for titillation.</p>
<p>Well, another halfway decent episode marred by bad conceptual choices, but at least not by shoddy animation or storytelling. Until next week,</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37519" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.42-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-20 at 8.25.42 AM" width="1280" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.42-AM.png 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.42-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.42-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.42-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.42-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-8.25.42-AM-620x388.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>*The Inners at this point all think Haruka is a man (not clear what gender they assign to Sailor Uranus. She’s in a Sailor Costume, but she also has a Tuxedo Mask-like cape and mask, so really her gender is still uncertain by the show’s standards). In the canon she’s a woman and in a lesbian relationship with Michiru, so I’m going to use the pronouns <em>her</em> and <em>she</em>, but I think the character here is actually rather gender fluid, and props to the show for that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apologies for the lateness of this recap. The current episode will also be recapped shortly!</p>
<p>Crystal started off last week so well, so it’s only natural that they’d begin this week with my least favorite holdover from the first series/second season, Usagi’s weird misplaced jealousy of Chibi-Usa’s time with Mamoru. Can’t let my hopes get too high, right? Usagi’s jealous this week of her <em>future daughter</em> spending time with that daughter’s <em>father</em>, since Mamoru is chaperoning a trip to an amusement park—whoa whoa whoa wait wait wait what the hell? Usagi’s mom can’t chaperone her eight year old, so she’s letting her 15 year-old daughter’s high-school aged boyfriend go in her place? Ugh, Crystal!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37453" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.05.50-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-19 at 8.05.50 AM" width="1280" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.05.50-AM.png 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.05.50-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.05.50-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.05.50-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.05.50-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.05.50-AM-620x388.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Fortunately, after the break it’s revealed that Mamoru is going so as to be close to Usagi &amp; co. when they infiltrate Mugen Academy. Unfortunately, Mamoru loses track of Chibi-Usa, who goes running off to get her hat. Which blows clean across the amusement park and toward Mugen. All right fine, I’m suspending my disbelief, but don’t make me regret it, Crystal.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37452" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.16.18-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-19 at 8.16.18 AM" width="1280" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.16.18-AM.png 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.16.18-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.16.18-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.16.18-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.16.18-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.16.18-AM-620x388.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Chibi-Usa blithely chases after her hat, Usagi blithely transforms herself into a Mugen Academy student to infiltrate the building, leaving behind her friends in what is inevitably going to be a bad plan. Usagi wanders the entirely empty halls, unchallenged and uncertain, until she hears the strains of a melody. Someone’s playing the violin! She goes to investigate and finds Michiru playing by her weird lonesome…</p>

<p>…while Haruka leaps down in front of the Inner Senshi like some kind of private school ninja. (Note: I would pay a lot to send my future kids to a school with ninja training.) Haruka and Michiru both warn our Inners away in the most vague, unhelpful way possible, and Usagi takes off running. She apparently runs around Mugen for so long that it gets dark outside, and, having wasted at least a few hours, finally wends her way out to find Chibi-Usa and a strange girl having some kind of issue.</p>
<p>Chibi-Usa has also wasted hours looking for her hat, telling no one of her whereabouts even as it got dark. Does no one in this universe have a cell phone? Or any common sense? Well, okay, Usagi never had much common sense. They try to help the young girl—Hotaru, obvi—who has literally fallen to her knees with pain, but she rebuffs them. But before they can press the issue, their brooches begin to glow. It’s a Reversion!</p>
<p>Oh god I’m going to have to write “Reversion” for <em>months.</em></p>
<p><em> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37454" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.19.05-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-19 at 8.19.05 AM" width="1280" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.19.05-AM.png 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.19.05-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.19.05-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.19.05-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.19.05-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.19.05-AM-620x388.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></em></p>
<p>Usagi and the rest transform, and Chibi-Usa’s transformation is super cute, I must admit. But did they have to show <em>everyone’s</em> transformation? I suppose so. Anyway, Mercury uses her 300 IQ and super analysis glasses to come to the radical conclusion that they should watch out for its claws. Thanks, Mercury! Still, the battle is well-animated and the attacks work well in concert. They succeed in defeatinging—oh, thank god, the Witches 5 show up and call it a Daimon, not a Reversion, so now I can sidestep that crap. Anyway, yes, they defeat the <em>Daimon</em>, protect Hotaru, and save the day.</p>

<p>Just in time for Mamoru to show up. Oh, Mamo-chan. You useless ol’ cutie. His contribution—a frantic “are you okay?!”—falls short of even that of the supposed bystander and sickly young girl Hotaru, who manages to rise to her feet and demand a few answers. They dispense with any pretense of ignorance that the blonde girl and pink-haired child are somehow different from the blonde and pink-haired Senshi (that always irked me in the original, so it’s refreshing to see it done away with here), and Chibi-Usa gives a ten-second explanation of their heroic background and mission. Cool! Hotaru is not terribly intimidated by this, and instead focuses on the fact that Chibi-Usa is a bit scratched up from the fight. She extends a hand and before anyone can react, heals Chibi-Usa’s wound.</p>

<p>There’s no time to react to this miracle, however, since Neptune and Uranus stand up and make their spying presence known. Not much more than that, though. They immediately flit off into the night, leaving the Inner Senshi to wonder about these new young ladies in sailor outfits.</p>

<p>I love that Haruka wears the white mask and cape with her Senshi uniform, just like Tuxedo Mask. It introduces a bit more gender bending here that I appreciate, and also subtly elevates Haruka and Michiru’s romance to the level of Usagi and Mamoru’s.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37457" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.23.12-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-19 at 8.23.12 AM" width="1280" height="800" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.23.12-AM.png 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.23.12-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.23.12-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.23.12-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.23.12-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-8.23.12-AM-620x388.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>All in all, another good episode, though not without blips of stupidity. I remain hopeful, but still not entirely convinced. So until next week,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sleeping-Giants-Sylvain-Neuvel-ebook/dp/B00ZNE44FK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1460205107&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sleeping+giants">Sleeping Giants</a> </em>by Sylvain Neuvel is the definition of compulsively readable. I snuck peeks at work, I held it in one hand while holding my toothbrush in the other, and if it had not been on my kindle, I would have propped it up within eyeball-reach of the shower. It&#8217;s engrossing. It&#8217;s fantastic. It&#8217;s a hundred superlatives dug up from all around the world and assembled into a gigantic amalgam of science and technology and the military and spycraft and psychology and delight.</p>
<p>Speaking of which&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-37083" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/tumblr_ntidmzPL781snjlnuo1_1280-e1014858620798.jpg" alt="tumblr_ntidmzPL781snjlnuo1_1280" width="288" height="411" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/tumblr_ntidmzPL781snjlnuo1_1280-e1014858620798.jpg 572w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/tumblr_ntidmzPL781snjlnuo1_1280-e1014858620798-210x300.jpg 210w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/tumblr_ntidmzPL781snjlnuo1_1280-e1014858620798-298x425.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" /></p>
<p>When Rose Franklin is a child, she falls into a pit of bright turquoise light. When they find her, she&#8217;s being cupped in the palm of a giant hand, safe and sound. The hand, however, is not intact. It might very well be a part of a larger structure, if only they could figure out what the symbols on it mean, or where it might have come from, or how to even locate other potential pieces. Twenty years later, Rose, now a physicist, is contacted to solve all those mysteries and more. She is joined by a scheming geneticist, an arrogant linguist, a brash pilot to discover what this thing is, and what it might mean. But who, exactly, has brought them together? Who is the one interviewing them, reading their journals, steering them in directions they may not like?</p>
<p>There are layers of mystery here that run the gamut from no bigger than the pilot&#8217;s damaged eye to as big as space itself. Who made these scattered body parts? And if they&#8217;re assembled, what part will this strange creation play on the world stage? As with our reality, this version of Earth has not banded together. Superpowers and corporations are still very much in control. The stakes have never been so high since the race to discover the atomic bomb, and thus the urgency and gravity of the characters&#8217; decisions never slackens. Despite taking place over the course of more than five years, this is a nail-biting race to the finish.</p>
<p>The format also contributes to the pacing and empathy with the characters. Done wrong, epistolary/found footage novels can be interminable bores, cycling through indistinguishable characters and piecemeal documents. Done right&#8211;like <em>World War Z </em>or <em>House of Leaves</em> were, as <em>Sleeping Giants</em> is&#8211;it&#8217;s a way to cut out every ounce of extraneous detail and get to the meat of the story. Everything is filtered through characters&#8217; voices, so every word does double-duty, building the environment, plot, and other scaffolding, and also letting the characters loose in it to act. It also frees the author from having to give the kind of transitional context necessary to a scientific endeavor: the characters complain about how long things take and how hard it is, but we can skip from revelation to revelation along with our mysterious and near-omniscient organizer.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-37084" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/tumblr_ntidmzPL781snjlnuo1_1280-1-e1014858694606.jpg" alt="tumblr_ntidmzPL781snjlnuo1_1280" width="306" height="419" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/tumblr_ntidmzPL781snjlnuo1_1280-1-e1014858694606.jpg 592w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/tumblr_ntidmzPL781snjlnuo1_1280-1-e1014858694606-219x300.jpg 219w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/tumblr_ntidmzPL781snjlnuo1_1280-1-e1014858694606-298x409.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" /></p>
<p>And even this nameless spook is a gem, a sly and ultimately sympathetic individual. Sylvain Neuvel does a superb job of creating believable and distinct personalities with just diary entries and interviews. The dialogue is completely natural, as fun as a Tarantino script and as riveting as a whole slew of Scorceses. There are elements of <em>Pacific Rim</em> here&#8211;giant mechs and human pilots, mostly&#8211;so if you&#8217;re into that, there&#8217;s more to love. If you&#8217;re not, don&#8217;t sweat it.  The story&#8217;s not some pale imitation, it&#8217;s a hundred-foot tall titan that stands on its own two feet. Yes, that&#8217;s a lot of movie comparisons, but the book is extremely filmic, infinitely visual despite having very little descriptive context. But that&#8217;s part of the greatness. You don&#8217;t need it. You don&#8217;t need anything except the next page, and maybe the one after that one, and every next page until the end, and then you&#8217;ll just need the next book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sleeping Giants</em> will be released April 26.</p>

<p>Bringing Jaela to Deephome was a risk but it most likely will not blow up in our faces. You have to take risks for people sometimes and double that if your saved the world together. Plus, Aludra deserves to see Jaela one last time. Sure, it will make things more complicated, but sometimes you have to deal with complicated situations. Like a chicken hatching out of its egg, you must be strong enough to face the challenges thrown your way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Hello! I&#8217;m back, once again, to give you my first impressions on an Anime that Transformation Sequence likely won&#8217;t have time to cover in full. As a reminder, what I consider a first impression of a show is watching the first three episodes. This gives the show time to introduce the world, the characters, the driving plot, and the antagonists. This week, I want to talk about <em>Divine Gate</em>.</p>
<div class="video"><iframe width="620" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WLWD-DcP0ko?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><em>Divine Gate</em> is about a group of kids with crazy elemental powers. They are gathered at a school (?) and are all striving toward the same goal: opening the legendary divine gate to have their wishes granted. Based on that description and how fun the opening is (posted above), you would think that this show probably doesn&#8217;t get very deep, but at least it looks cool and has a lot of action! You would only be kind of correct. There is a lot to not like about this show, and yet it&#8217;s all very intriguing at the same time. For the Transformation Sequence faithful, you might remember our winter 2016 season episode where I watched and talked about the first episode. My feelings are still the same on it.</p>
<div class="video"><iframe width="620" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F245925121&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=620&#038;maxheight=930"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s really hard to pick out the good in this show. About the only thing that is really pulling me in for more is our main characters&#8217; back stories. Specifically Aota&#8217;s, since his involves a creepy younger brother. Akane&#8217;s and Midori&#8217;s back stories are decent enough, but they don&#8217;t do anything interesting with their personalities. Akane is supposed to have father issues, but all I get is that he is kind of mad when people don&#8217;t try their hardest. Midori&#8217;s character is all over the place. The first two episodes paint her as a compassionate air-head, but the third episode (her back story episode) has her acting like a goof ball with a dark past. I wish they would cut the fat and just focus on Aota&#8217;s relationship with his younger brother because the visuals they use for his flashbacks with him are chilling.</p>
<div id="attachment_37418" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37418 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divinegate2.png" alt="divinegate2" width="960" height="541" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divinegate2.png 960w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divinegate2-300x169.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divinegate2-768x433.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divinegate2-298x168.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divinegate2-620x349.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Do more of this please!</p></div>
<p>So lets get to the bad because there is a lot of it. I&#8217;ve already touched on how borderline to flat out poor the main characters are, and the same applies to everyone else in the show. You can easily tell a character is going to have no substance when they over dress the hell out of them, and most of the side characters in this show are covered in the gaudiest accessories. Watching the second and third episodes, I knew the plot and writing were probably not going to improve, but I was hopeful that the action scenes would be good. I was wrong. The big fight in episode two is almost enitrely CG, and not good CG either. It looks like they had basic 3D models and copy/pasted the character&#8217;s faces and outfits on them. It&#8217;s incredibly jarring and it makes me sad. The whole plot, by the way, is a complete mess. By the end of the third episode, all I could figure out was that there was a crazy stone door everyone wanted to find, and they were close to finding it, maybe.</p>
<div id="attachment_37419" style="width: 971px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37419 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Divine-gate.png" alt="Divine gate" width="961" height="540" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Divine-gate.png 961w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Divine-gate-300x169.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Divine-gate-768x432.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Divine-gate-298x167.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Divine-gate-620x348.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 961px) 100vw, 961px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">My feelings exactly.</p></div>
<p><em>Divine Gate</em> had a lot of promise on the surface, but it barely delivers on it. A confusing plot, poorly written characters, and terrible animation all lead to a big pass for me. It&#8217;s a real shame because that elemental powers concept is actually pretty cool, and that opening song gets me quite hyped up. See you next time!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy, everypony!</p>
<p>The <em>My Little Pony CCG </em>has a new expansion coming out in about a month: <em>Marks in Time</em>, which officially debuts in May. Enterplay has been spoiling cards left and right on <a href="https://twitter.com/MLP_CCG">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Enterplayllc">Facebook</a>, and they&#8217;ve published a few features on <a href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/search/label/Cards">Equestria Daily</a>, too. In the run-up my friend Niko White also wrote an article discussing the upcoming rules change (<a href="http://team-pandeponium.horse/?p=626">the removal of the first-confront bonus</a>) that also goes live with <em>Marks in Time</em>.</p>
<p>Today I get to join the fun, too, with not one, not two, but <em>three</em> brand-new cards. First, I&#8217;ve got two new cards from a cycle you (may) already know about. Then, I have a sneaky little snake that&#8217;s sure to be a hit for Critter decks everywhere. Let&#8217;s get to it!</p>
<p>(Full disclosure: I&#8217;m an external playtester for the <em>MLP CCG</em> and helped playtest cards from <em>Marks in Time</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s What My Cutie Mark Is Telling Me</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve seen any <em>Marks in Time</em> previews so far, you&#8217;ve probably seen the set&#8217;s marquee mechanic: Cutie Marking. So I don&#8217;t see any reason to make you wait for my first two preview cards: world? Meet filly Rarity and filly Pinkie Pie.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37393" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/46-Rarity-Growing-Up.png" alt="46 Rarity, Growing Up" width="359" height="500" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/46-Rarity-Growing-Up.png 359w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/46-Rarity-Growing-Up-215x300.png 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/46-Rarity-Growing-Up-298x415.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37392" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/30-Pinkie-Pie-Growing-Up.png" alt="30 Pinkie Pie, Growing Up" width="359" height="500" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/30-Pinkie-Pie-Growing-Up.png 359w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/30-Pinkie-Pie-Growing-Up-215x300.png 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/30-Pinkie-Pie-Growing-Up-298x415.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></p>
<p>These cute little foals are part of a common cycle: each of the Mane Six gets a &#8220;Growing Up&#8221; card that shows the character before they got their Cutie Mark. <a href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2016/04/marks-in-time-cutie-marks-arent-just.html#more">You can see the Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy cards on Equestria Daily</a>, if you haven&#8217;t already. Since I had a hand in playtesting them, I figured I&#8217;d give a little &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; peek into the design process for the Cutie Mark Cards.</p>
<p>The design team&#8217;s vision was that Cutie Marking should feel appropriately momentous. <em>Friendship Is Magic</em> treats Cutie Marks as a big deal. Getting your Cutie Mark is an event, and the design team wanted the game to reflect that: it should be a significant investment, that also comes with a significant reward.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37389" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PartyFilly_Rara.png" alt="PartyFilly_Rara" width="714" height="565" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PartyFilly_Rara.png 714w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PartyFilly_Rara-300x237.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PartyFilly_Rara-298x236.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PartyFilly_Rara-620x491.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px" />For gameplay reasons, it&#8217;s best that all the Cutie Mark cards work the same way. The designers can then make each card unique by varying the abilities it has before it&#8217;s Cutie Marked, and varying the benefits it has afterward. Ideally, each card presents a tiny little before-and-after story that conveys a sense of growth and accomplishment.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37385" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/37-Starlight-Glimmer-Apprentice-Sorcerer.png" alt="37 Starlight Glimmer, Apprentice Sorcerer" width="358" height="500" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/37-Starlight-Glimmer-Apprentice-Sorcerer.png 358w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/37-Starlight-Glimmer-Apprentice-Sorcerer-215x300.png 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/37-Starlight-Glimmer-Apprentice-Sorcerer-298x416.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37383" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/4-Babs-Seed-Anti-Bully.png" alt="4 Babs Seed, Anti-Bully" width="359" height="500" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/4-Babs-Seed-Anti-Bully.png 359w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/4-Babs-Seed-Anti-Bully-215x300.png 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/4-Babs-Seed-Anti-Bully-298x415.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" />That also means Cutie Mark cards have to stand on their own both before </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">and</em><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> after they get Cutie Marked. It makes sense that Cutie Marking a Friend has to be a big improvement to be worth it; 2 AT is a lot to spend, especially when you could just play a different card from your hand.</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, if the card is irrelevant <em>before</em> you Cutie Mark it, it feels a bit pointless, like you aren&#8217;t getting your full card&#8217;s worth until you pay the extra AT for the Cutie Mark. At that point, there&#8217;s little reason not to just make the card cost more and have more power.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37386" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/42-Diamond-Tiara-Newfound-Friend.png" alt="42 Diamond Tiara, Newfound Friend" width="358" height="500" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/42-Diamond-Tiara-Newfound-Friend.png 358w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/42-Diamond-Tiara-Newfound-Friend-215x300.png 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/42-Diamond-Tiara-Newfound-Friend-298x416.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37384" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/15-Apple-Bloom-Forever-a-Crusader.png" alt="15 Apple Bloom, Forever a Crusader" width="359" height="500" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/15-Apple-Bloom-Forever-a-Crusader.png 359w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/15-Apple-Bloom-Forever-a-Crusader-215x300.png 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/15-Apple-Bloom-Forever-a-Crusader-298x415.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" />Designers can force players to notice a mechanic, if they need to. Consider cards like Diamond Tiara, Newfound Friend and Apple Bloom, Forever a Crusader. These cards care about Cutie Marks, and tell you so pretty loudly. They might even compel a player to put otherwise lackluster Cutie Mark Friends in their decks. But this feels a little tacked-on, and players notice. It&#8217;s much better design to make sure a Cutie Mark card is reasonable before it&#8217;s Cutie Marked, and that Cutie Marking it feels like a reward worth paying for.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37390" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RD_BlueMark.png" alt="RD_BlueMark" width="358" height="500" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RD_BlueMark.png 358w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RD_BlueMark-215x300.png 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RD_BlueMark-298x416.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37387" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FS_YellowMark.png" alt="FS_YellowMark" width="359" height="500" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FS_YellowMark.png 359w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FS_YellowMark-215x300.png 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FS_YellowMark-298x415.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" />That brings us back around to the Mane Six, Growing Up cycle. The cards all started as 2-power Friends that cost 2 AT, which picked up an extra point of power and an extra ability when Cutie Marked. (Originally, Friends didn&#8217;t all get a +1 power counter when Cutie Marked, which made the mechanic a little hard to parse across multiple cards.) We playtesters liked the simplicity, but Cutie Marking didn&#8217;t feel like enough of a payoff. 4 AT for 3 power isn&#8217;t an especially good rate; and, moreover, we&#8217;d seen lots of 2 AT 2-power Friends, so the base version of the card didn&#8217;t feel unique.</p>
<p>Working with playtester feedback, the developers hit on the version you see here. These played much better. The 1 AT 1-power Friend is a frame we haven&#8217;t seen much since <em>Premiere</em>, so it felt special. (Plus, it really makes the cards feel like they&#8217;re kid versions of the Mane Six.) Meanwhile, 3 total AT for 3 power is also an attractive card. In playtest games, Cutie Marking the Mane Six felt exciting and powerful. The upgrade was meaningful, and more importantly, it captured the feel of helping your Friends grow up and unlock their full potential.</p>
<p>I hope you all enjoy playing with Cutie Mark cards in <em>Marks in Time</em>. They were a blast to playtest, and thanks to the hard work of the dev team, they wound up in a really fun place.</p>
<p><strong>Fighting Right</strong></p>
<p>Next up: a card for all you Critter lovers! As a Critter fan myself—ever since I put together <a href="http://ponyhead.com/img/cards/hm94.jpg">Rise and Shine</a> and <a href="http://ponyhead.com/img/cards/hm108.jpg">Fast Food</a> in my first draft deck—I&#8217;m pretty excited to get to show this card off to you for the first time. Give a cheer for Battlesnakes, Hissy Fit!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37394" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/50-Battlesnakes-Hissy-Fit.png" alt="50 Battlesnakes, Hissy Fit" width="359" height="500" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/50-Battlesnakes-Hissy-Fit.png 359w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/50-Battlesnakes-Hissy-Fit-215x300.png 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/50-Battlesnakes-Hissy-Fit-298x415.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></p>
<p>The snakes are cheering, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever played a Critter deck, you know that Yellow can have some issues busting through Troublemakers. Yellow doesn&#8217;t get the <a href="http://ponyhead.com/img/cards/pr115.jpg">fast movement</a>, <a href="http://ponyhead.com/img/cards/cg9.jpg">out-of-turn confrontation</a>, or <a href="http://ponyhead.com/img/cards/cn51.jpg">bypassing </a>abilities other colors have. Instead, Yellow usually has to overpower opposing TMs. Often, this means playing or moving Friends to the TM&#8217;s problem during your Main Phase and hoping that holds up. Good TM decks, which defend their Troublemakers with forced movement and frighten effects, can really punish those plays.</p>
<p>Yellow does have a few tools available to fight Troublemakers (<a href="http://ponyhead.com/img/cards/eo90.jpg">Princess Celestia, Smite Makes Right</a>; <a href="http://ponyhead.com/img/cards/cg90.jpg">Princess Celestia, Bane of Evil</a>; <a href="http://ponyhead.com/img/cards/eo139.jpg">Splash Attack</a>). But they tend to be poor fits for Critter decks. They can be narrow. They&#8217;re pretty expensive, which is a tough sell for a deck that&#8217;s trying to keep its AT cost as low as possible. Plus, they&#8217;re not Critters. Critter decks tend to rely on <a href="http://ponyhead.com/cards/cn7/fluttershy-friend-to-animals">Fluttershy, Friend to Animals</a> as a high-powered Mane that shores up the naturally low powers of their Friends, so every non-Critter card they include comes at a cost.</p>
<p>Left with few other choices, it&#8217;s natural to turn to the nuclear option:</p>
<div id="attachment_37293" style="width: 354px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37293 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Friend_TreeHugger.jpg" alt="Pictured: Get wrecked, Troublemaker decks." width="344" height="480" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Friend_TreeHugger.jpg 344w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Friend_TreeHugger-215x300.jpg 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Friend_TreeHugger-298x416.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Again I say: TM decks, get wrecked.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tree Hugger&#8217;s not a Critter, but she&#8217;s so powerful she&#8217;s worth going off theme. Unfortunately, she can sometimes be a little <em>too</em> good. &#8220;Turn off Troublemakers&#8221; is fair in a tournament, but it&#8217;s less good for games with your friends. It&#8217;s a cool deckbuilding challenge to find just the right card to win fun games. It&#8217;s less fun to find a card that blanks half your opponent&#8217;s deck.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to try Battlesnakes, Hissy Fit as a fun, fair, interactive option to give Critter decks another way to dodge Troublemakers. Often, buying just a turn or two—exactly what Battlesnakes gives you—can put you far enough ahead in points to close the game. As a cheap Critter, Battlesnakes is easy to sneak into a big turn, but can also be part of your fast Critter openings, if that&#8217;s what you need.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37406" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ce1VjN6WsAAerhP.jpg" alt="Ce1VjN6WsAAerhP" width="540" height="700" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ce1VjN6WsAAerhP.jpg 540w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ce1VjN6WsAAerhP-231x300.jpg 231w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ce1VjN6WsAAerhP-298x386.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" />Plus, as a straight Yellow Friend, Battlesnakes can fit into all sorts of new Critter decks beyond your typical Yellow-White Cratus/Tree Hugger decks. In particular, I&#8217;m excited to try them alongside Pinkie Pie, One Filly Party in a Yellow-Pink tokens deck. Critter tokens and Earth Pony tokens together? I&#8217;m in.</p>
<p>Or maybe Critters aren&#8217;t quite your speed? <em>Marks </em>has you covered there, too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37432" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CgBN3awWcAAElT9.jpg_large.jpeg" alt="CgBN3awWcAAElT9.jpg_large" width="359" height="500" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CgBN3awWcAAElT9.jpg_large.jpeg 359w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CgBN3awWcAAElT9.jpg_large-215x300.jpeg 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CgBN3awWcAAElT9.jpg_large-298x415.jpeg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></p>
<p>Repulsor Blast is essentially a one-shot Tree Hugger, which can buy you a critical turn to get ahead or stay ahead. Even better, if you can force a double-face off (a fracas, if you will), you can refresh problems and get rid of the Troublemaker for good. To help, <em>Marks</em> also includes cool new Dilemmas to give additional avenues to confront multiple Problems in a turn:</p>
<div class="video">

<p>Suffice to say Yellow is going to get some cool new toys when <em>Marks in Time </em>drops in May! I&#8217;m really looking forward to it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to Magic Gatherings!</p>
<p>The latest <strong>Magic</strong> set, <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em>, officially released last week, so it&#8217;s time to talk limited. This week I&#8217;ll discuss the set&#8217;s major mechanics and themes, with an eye toward general principles for drafting it. Next week I&#8217;ll delve into the colors&#8217; strengths and weaknesses, and cover the bases of the format&#8217;s major archetypes. Let&#8217;s get to it!</p>
<p><strong>The Long Shadows of <em>Innistrad</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Shadows over Innistrad</em> returns to the eponymous gothic horror plane, one of the most popular settings in <strong>Magic</strong>&#8216;s history. In addition to nailing the flavor and feel of its source material, the original <em>Innistrad</em> is fondly remembered for its deep draft environment—possibly <em>the best</em> of all time. Almost every card in <em>Innistrad </em>had a use somewhere, though their value could vary wildly: cards that were lynchpins of certain strategies were utterly worthless to other decks. As players discovered new uses for previously underappreciated gems, the format evolved, and actually became more robust the more it was drafted. It was a bit like discovering the Dampen Thought deck in <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/magic-gatherings-33-remembering-kamigawa/">Kamigawa draft</a>, except that it happened multiple times with multiple cards over the course of the format.</p>
<p><em>Shadows over Innistrad</em> has a lot to live up to, in other words. But my first experiences with the format have left me optimistic. <em>SoI</em>&#8216;s mechanics interact in subtle ways to make for a good environment, and its cards have a lot of depth—sometimes they&#8217;re good, and sometimes they&#8217;re <em>great</em>, and sometimes that can even happen in the same game.</p>
<p><strong>Methods to the Madness</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on with the mechanics in <em>Shadows</em>, which are more complicated than in your average set. They mesh together quite well, though, in ways that are sometimes obvious, sometimes less so.</p>
<p><em>Double-Faced Cards</em>—The most iconic &#8220;<em>Innistrad </em>mechanic,&#8221; double-faced cards can transform during play to become more powerful. You always cast the front side (with the mana cost and the sun icon in the upper-left corner), but when specific conditions described on the card are met, you flip the card onto its back side.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-37332 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_ConvictedKiller-e1460750505965.png" alt="Combo_ConvictedKiller" width="461" height="322" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_ConvictedKiller-e1460750505965.png 461w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_ConvictedKiller-e1460750505965-300x210.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_ConvictedKiller-e1460750505965-298x208.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></p>
<p>Transforming is a flexible mechanic, so these cards can do all sorts of things. The most cohesive subset are the werewolves, which all share the same transformation condition: if a turn passes with no player casting a spell, they flip from their human side to their werewolf side; if a single player casts two or more spells in a turn, they flip from their werewolf side to their human side.</p>
<p>Werewolves really appreciate having instant-speed cards, since a common play pattern is to pass your own turn without playing a spell to flip your werewolves on your opponent&#8217;s upkeep; it&#8217;s important to be able to cast something on your opponent&#8217;s turn, so you don&#8217;t take the full turn cycle off. By the same token, instants are good against werewolves—an end-step spell from your opponent will foil your &#8220;pass to flip&#8221; plan.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other transform cards, especially ones that transform from one card type to another. These work case-by-case, so read carefully.</p>
<div id="attachment_37333" style="width: 469px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37333 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_SkinInvasion-e1460750445191.png" alt="Combo_SkinInvasion" width="459" height="322" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_SkinInvasion-e1460750445191.png 459w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_SkinInvasion-e1460750445191-300x210.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_SkinInvasion-e1460750445191-298x209.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Reading some cards may be more traumatic than others.</p></div>
<p><em>Madness</em>—Another returning mechanic, <em>madness</em> allows you to cast spells when you discard them.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37334" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_FieryTemper.png" alt="Card_FieryTemper" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_FieryTemper.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_FieryTemper-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37335" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_TwinsOfMaurerEstate.png" alt="Card_TwinsOfMaurerEstate" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_TwinsOfMaurerEstate.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_TwinsOfMaurerEstate-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37336" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_WelcomeToTheFold.png" alt="Card_WelcomeToTheFold" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_WelcomeToTheFold.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_WelcomeToTheFold-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />Creature spells discarded with <em>madness </em>will wind up on the battlefield after you play them. Instants and sorceries take effect, then go to the graveyard as part of their resolution per normal. Occasionally, as with <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Welcome to the Fold">Welcome to the Fold</a>, cards will have different effects when you play them via <em>madness</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, to play a spell with <em>madness</em>, something has to make you discard it—you can&#8217;t just pitch it from your hand because you feel like it. For that reason, <em>Shadows</em> has a high density of effects that force discard or allow you to discard for a benefit.</p>
<p><em><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37339" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Catalog.png" alt="Card_Catalog" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Catalog.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Catalog-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37340" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_MadProphet.png" alt="Card_MadProphet" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_MadProphet.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_MadProphet-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37338" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_CalltheBloodline.png" alt="Card_CalltheBloodline" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_CalltheBloodline.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_CalltheBloodline-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />Madness</em> usually gives a discount of a mana or two off the spell&#8217;s full price. It also has a subtle side benefit: it can give you ways to cast spells at instant speed, when you normally wouldn&#8217;t be able to. If your opponent attacks with an <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Inspiring Captain">Inspiring Captain</a>, you can activate <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Mad Prophet">Mad Prophet</a>, discard <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Twins of Maurer Estate">Twins of Maurer Estate</a> to the Prophet&#8217;s ability, and use <em>madness</em> to cast the Twins. Essentially, you <em>flash</em> in a 3/5 blocker and draw a card for your troubles.</p>
<p>When drafting, it&#8217;s helpful to keep in mind both your <em>madness</em> cards and your <em>madness enablers</em>, the discard outlets that give you windows to cast <em>madness</em> cards. You&#8217;ll need a high count of both if you want your deck to run smoothly. Bear in mind that if your discard outlet is a spell like <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Catalog">Catalog</a> or <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Macabre Waltz">Macabre Waltz</a>, you&#8217;ll need to pay the mana cost for that spell in addition to whatever the madness cost for the card you discard is, which can add up. Permanent, repeatable discard, like the ability on <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Mad Prophet">Mad Prophet</a>, is very good in a dedicated <em>madness</em> deck.</p>
<p><em>Delirium</em>—Lots of cards being discarded means lots of cards in graveyards. The third major mechanic, <em>delirium</em>, takes advantage of this.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37346" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_MoldgrafScavenger.png" alt="Card_MoldgrafScavenger" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_MoldgrafScavenger.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_MoldgrafScavenger-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37347" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Topplegeist.png" alt="Card_Topplegeist" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Topplegeist.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Topplegeist-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37348" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_TraverseTheUlvenwald.png" alt="Card_TraverseTheUlvenwald" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_TraverseTheUlvenwald.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_TraverseTheUlvenwald-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /><em>Delirium </em>is a &#8220;threshold&#8221; style mechanic, which means that it &#8220;turns on&#8221; when a certain in-game condition is met. (The original mechanic, <em>threshold</em><em>, </em>gave additional or alternate abilities to cards when you had seven cards in your graveyard.) In the case of<em> delirium</em>, you need four different card types among the cards of your graveyard. Getting creatures, sorceries, and instants into your graveyard tends to happen normally over the course of the game. Binning artifacts, enchantments, and lands usually requires a little more effort.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37349" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_VesselOfNascency.png" alt="Card_VesselOfNascency" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_VesselOfNascency.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_VesselOfNascency-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37354" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_MercilessResolve.png" alt="Card_MercilessResolve" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_MercilessResolve.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_MercilessResolve-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />As with <em>madness</em>, <em>delirium</em> often requires a little effort to set up. Cards that sacrifice themselves, like the common Vessel cycle, can be a good way to get a card in the graveyard—<a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Vessel of Nascency">Vessel of Nascency</a> will sometimes set up <em>delirium</em> all by itself. Some spells, like <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Angelic Purge">Angelic Purge</a>, allow you to sacrifice a card in play. Anything that puts cards from your library directly into your graveyard (<a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Crawling Sensation">Crawling Sensation</a>, say), can add value. And, of course, discard outlets can do double duty. Balance is important here, too—you&#8217;ll need to make sure you have enough enablers that your powerful <em>delirium</em> cards reliably turn on, but not so much that your deck is full of low-impact effects. Look for cards that replace themselves or add value incidentally, and don&#8217;t cost much mana.</p>
<p><em>Investigate and Clue Tokens</em>—The last major mechanic, <em>investigate</em>, is a new keyword action. When you investigate, you put a token artifact called a Clue onto the battlefield under your control. All Clues have the ability to sacrifice themselves (for a small fee) to draw a card.</p>

<p>Clues show up in a lot of places. Sometimes, they&#8217;re a &#8220;rider&#8221;—a small bonus you get in addition to a larger effect. Other times, a card can give you Clues repeatedly, whenever some game action occurs.</p>
<p><em><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37359" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_ThrabenInspector.png" alt="Card_ThrabenInspector" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_ThrabenInspector.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_ThrabenInspector-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37360" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_UlvenwaldMysteries.png" alt="Card_UlvenwaldMysteries" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_UlvenwaldMysteries.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_UlvenwaldMysteries-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37358" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_TamiyosJournal.png" alt="Card_TamiyosJournal" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_TamiyosJournal.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_TamiyosJournal-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />Investigate </em>adds some much-needed smoothing to the format. Even when it works toward a larger benefit like <em>madness</em> or <em>delirium</em>, &#8220;discard and/or sacrifice a lot&#8221; is an unappealing set theme for a lot of players. It can also lead to stalled games—you can only discard for value so many times before you miss a key land drop or find yourself without a play to make on an late turn. With a Clue<em> </em>token handy, you can pay a little mana (conveniently, on a turn you probably weren&#8217;t doing anything else anyway) to dig for action.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37357" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_GrafMole.png" alt="Card_GrafMole" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_GrafMole.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_GrafMole-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37356" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_FleetingMemories.png" alt="Card_FleetingMemories" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_FleetingMemories.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_FleetingMemories-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-37355" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_BriarbridgePatrol.png" alt="Card_BriarbridgePatrol" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_BriarbridgePatrol.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_BriarbridgePatrol-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />Uncommon &#8220;Clues matter&#8221; cards give some build-around payoffs to drive Clue-focused decks. The effects on these cards vary widely, but they share a theme of turning <em>investigate</em> into a value engine that generates additional effects. There can be tension here: repeatedly <em>investigating</em> can help you find key cards, but cracking Clues costs mana and doesn&#8217;t affect the battlefield. Be sure you have ways to keep pace with your opponent while you piece together the puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>Meshing Mechanics</strong></p>
<p>These mechanics intersect in subtle ways to make for interesting play decisions. <em>Madness</em> requires lots of discard outlets, which can be repurposed as avenues to get additional cards into your graveyard for <em>delirium</em>. Werewolves draw focus to instant-speed cards, and <em>madness</em> creates more instant-speed windows to cast cards that can affect the battlefield. Sacrificing permanents can help turn on <em>delirium</em>, but if you like your cards, you can sacrifice a Clue you happen to have lying around.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of minor mechanical themes, too, some of which only show up on a few cards. Several creatures, like <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Nearheath Chaplain">Nearheath Chaplain</a>, exile themselves from the graveyard to make tokens. Some creatures return from the graveyard when you discard a few cards. Several green cards retrieve lands from the graveyard—a nice touch, because lands are what most players are likely to discard. There are tribal themes (Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies, Spirits, and Humans) for each allied color pair. There&#8217;s a bit of &#8220;equipment matters&#8221; running around.</p>
<p>All in all, the mechanics of <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em> come together to make a robust environment with a lot of texture. But how do the cards play? So far, pretty great.</p>
<p><strong>Changing/Contextual Card Evaluations</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the interesting ways the mechanics combine, the individual cards of <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em> have a lot of depth. In particular, their power can vary considerably based on what else is in your deck.</p>
<p>Last week I went 3-0 with a green-white humans deck, which is a good object lesson in how the power of <em>Shadows</em> cards can depend on the larger context of your deck:</p>
<div class="video">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">3-0 draft at 1st Shadows over Innistrad FNM. Hyped for the format: tons of people had epic plays tonight. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGSOI?src=hash">#MTGSOI</a> <a href="https://t.co/VhK3BXppZT">pic.twitter.com/VhK3BXppZT</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Harry Huberty (@cutefuzzy_) <a href="https://twitter.com/cutefuzzy_/status/718655444370251776">April 9, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/True-Faith Censer">True-Faith Censer</a>, for example, was a surprise all-star. The powers and toughnesses in this set are clustered pretty tightly in the 2–3 range, so +1/+1 is a relevant bonus. (When it turned my <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Dauntless Cathar">Dauntless Cathar</a>s into 5/3s, they could push through or trade with basically anything.) With so many incidental tokens, I always had things to equip to. And when the board stalled out, even a 1/1 Spirit token could pick up the Censer to become a relevant threat.</p>
<p>The <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Moorland Drifter">Moorland Drifter</a>s, on the other hand, were pretty bad. I was never anywhere close to <em>delirium</em>, so they were only ever 2/2s. Usually, my opponent would hold them off with a 2/3 on turn three. At that point, they were waiting to pick up the Censer before they could do anything besides double-block.</p>
<p>That said, I can certainly imagine the Drifters being stellar in a deck more focused on <em>delirium. </em>If I had drafted, say, two or three copies of <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Vessel of Nascency">Vessel of Nascency</a>, they would have had <em>flying</em> pretty frequently. Consider this curve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn 1: <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Vessel of Nascency">Vessel of Nascency</a>.</li>
<li>Turn 2: <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Moorland Drifter">Moorland Drifter</a>.</li>
<li>Turn 3: <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Paranoid Parish-Blade">Paranoid Parish-Blade</a>; swing for 2.</li>
<li>Turn 4: Sacrifice <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Vessel of Nascency">Vessel of Nascency</a>; enable <em>delirium</em>; swing for 6; play <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Moldgraf Scavenger">Moldgraf Scavenger</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds exciting, right? It also sounds like an entirely different deck. It&#8217;s still green-white, and it even uses many of the same cards, but the deck&#8217;s focus and payoffs are something else. The cards that were merely okay in my draft deck seem amazing here. And conversely, Vessel of Nascency would have been fine in my deck—it always at least gives a little card selection—but it&#8217;s clearly the key card here.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what really has me excited for <em>Shadows over Innistrad </em>limited: so many of the cards are contextually powerful. They&#8217;re decent in most decks, but have incredible potential when surrounded by just the right supporting cast. Even better, many of the cards are flexible in application: they can potentially contribute to a lot of different decks, but finding just the right shell to maximize them is a fun challenge.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37362" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_InsolentNeonate.png" alt="Card_InsolentNeonate" width="223" height="311" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_InsolentNeonate.png 223w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_InsolentNeonate-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></p>
<p><a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Insolent Neonate">Insolent Neonate</a> makes for a great example of these aspect of <em>SoI</em>&#8216;s cards. <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Suntail Hawk">Suntail Hawk</a> is not a good limited card, and a 1/1 <em>menace</em> is equally unappealing. But in a dedicated <em>madness</em> deck, the Neonate is essentially an instant-speed discard outlet that doesn&#8217;t cost a card, which might also get in for a few points of damage. One could also press it into service in a <em>delirium</em> deck, where it can add two cards types to the graveyard at instant speed. And in a pinch, it could do work in an aggressive Vampire tribal deck as an early threat that&#8217;s not a total dud in the late game. It has broad applications, but its power depends on context.</p>
<p><em><img class="aligncenter wp-image-37329 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_HinterlandLoggerTimberShredder-e1460749990451.jpg" alt="Combo_HinterlandLoggerTimberShredder" width="459" height="317" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_HinterlandLoggerTimberShredder-e1460749990451.jpg 459w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_HinterlandLoggerTimberShredder-e1460749990451-300x207.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_HinterlandLoggerTimberShredder-e1460749990451-298x206.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" />Shadows </em>cards also have contextual power within individual games, gaining more strength as circumstances around them change. Werewolves are a good example here. They are a good aggressive archetype, as they punish slow starts; if you open on Hinterland Logger, your opponent is already in trouble if they pass turn two without a play. But because werewolves also pick up substantial stat bonuses when they transform, they remain relevant late into the game—especially so once both players have run low on spells and passing the turn with no plays becomes less punishing.</p>
<div id="attachment_37331" style="width: 479px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37331 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_SolitaryHunterOneOfThePack-e1460750114540.png" alt="Combo_SolitaryHunterOneOfThePack" width="469" height="327" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_SolitaryHunterOneOfThePack-e1460750114540.png 469w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_SolitaryHunterOneOfThePack-e1460750114540-300x209.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Combo_SolitaryHunterOneOfThePack-e1460750114540-298x208.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Solitary Hunter is a great on-curve play that becomes a serious late-game threat when your opponent is in topdeck mode.</p></div>
<p><em>Delirium</em> works this way too. While some <em>delirium </em>decks will abuse it for some explosive starts, many other <em>delirium</em> cards gain incidental power or utility as the game goes on—essentially the way I tried to play <a class="deckbox_link" target="_blank" href="https://deckbox.org/mtg/Moorland Drifter">Moorland Drifter</a> in my draft deck.</p>
<p><strong>Deepening <em>Shadows</em></strong></p>
<p>Only time will tell if <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em> is truly the heir to the original <em>Innistrad</em>&#8216;s legendary limited format, but I&#8217;m optimistic. The pieces of the set—the mechanics, the cards—all fit together to make a complex and interesting puzzle, so the tools are there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be back next week with a more in-depth look at color pairs and archetypes. In the meantime, reach out on Twitter or in the comments to let me know what your most epic <em>Shadows over Innistrad</em> limited moments have been!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Korean fiction is only just now coming into vogue, with Kyung-Sook Shin and Han Kang making waves in lit circles and bestseller lists. Here are some Korean novels to get you started.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37072" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/8131789-150x150.jpg" alt="8131789" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/8131789-150x150.jpg 150w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/8131789-180x180.jpg 180w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/8131789-300x300.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/8131789-75x75.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>1. <em>Y<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Your-Republic-Calling-You-Young-ha/dp/0151015457/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1460204035&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=your+republic+is+calling+you">our Republic Is Calling You</a></em> (Young-Ha Kim) &#8211; Though I prefer his earlier novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Right-Destroy-Myself-Harvest-Original/dp/0156030802/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=51SD0Nt49FL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL320_SR214%2C320_&amp;refRID=15D6562JB71V2G08VHRY"><em>I Have the Right to Destroy Myself</em></a>, this book will undoubtedly have broader appeal. An ordinary man working in Seoul receives a message. Is he a North Korean sleeper agent? How much does his family know? How much does each country want to help him&#8211;or bring him down? Less action than you might expect, but more insight into the Two Koreas, and Gi-yeong&#8217;s daughter is an unexpectedly brilliant character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37074" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/gongourhappytimeuk-150x150.jpg" alt="gong+our+happy+time+uk" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/gongourhappytimeuk-150x150.jpg 150w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/gongourhappytimeuk-180x180.jpg 180w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/gongourhappytimeuk-300x300.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/gongourhappytimeuk-75x75.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Our-Happy-Time-Gong-Ji-young-ebook/dp/B00EMDPUWO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1460204017&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=our+happy+time"><em>Our Happy Time</em></a> (Ji-young Gong) &#8211; If you like Korean dramas, you&#8217;ll like this book. At times melodramatic, at times too dependent on tropes, it still has a great deal of emotional power and insight. A rape survivor accompanies her aunt to meet with a man on death row, a rapist and murderer. The impossible costs of forgiveness and compassion are tenderly shown.</p>

An elderly woman goes missing on the subway. Who, exactly is she? She&#8217;s many different people, depending on who&#8217;s asking: her husband, her children, her love from long ago, and herself. The tumultuous history of postwar Korea finds very personal expression in these interwoven glimpses of a woman&#8217;s long, difficult, and triumphant life.</p>

Also about ethical choices and impossible situations, and not meant to be funny, but yeah, being vegetarian in Korea is really difficult and apparently also destroys bonds of love and family.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-37318" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Geeklies-Draft-1200x675.jpg" alt="Geeklies-Draft" width="620" height="349" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Geeklies-Draft-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Geeklies-Draft-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Geeklies-Draft-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Geeklies-Draft-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Geeklies-Draft-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Kyle Fergusson is back to give me another slice of learnin&#8217; cake&#8230;.learnin&#8217;&#8230;.pie? If you missed my last session with Kyle, the host of Into the Nexus and Solo Q&amp;A, we talked a lot about Li-Ming who was my bread and butter at the time. Unfortunately, since that time bans have been introduced into the game so I haven&#8217;t been able to play much Li-Ming in Hero League (ranked play). In fact, I haven&#8217;t been able to play any. But despite how salty I feel, that&#8217;s not why we&#8217;re here.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been super effective. Last time, I expressed how stuck I felt in my own MMR. I was hanging out around rank 34 and had been unable to move. Since then, I&#8217;ve been climbing steadily, currently at rank 27. I attribute this to a combination of the knowledge I gained from Kyle and a conscious effort that I&#8217;ve been putting forth to stay positive during my games. (I posted more about the latter part on Reddit, which you can find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4bms3w/im_trying_a_hot_new_strategy_for_my_hots_games/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>This time we spent most of our time talking about the draft process. Specifically, how do you synergize what you&#8217;re good at playing with what your team is picking, while at the same time leveraging that against the enemy team and their own picks? This is becoming a much larger issue recently, as bans seem to be forcing teams in hero league to actually discuss their picks. That means more thought needs to go into how heroes work together. I feel like this session was invaluable in helping me sort through that mess. You can watch in it&#8217;s entirety here, with Kyle&#8217;s notes below. (Apologies in advance for my absolutely terrible audio quality. You&#8217;d think by now I would remember to select the proper microphone.) Even further down, see how you can find his content and book a session for yourself.</p>

<blockquote><p>Kyle&#8217;s Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Banning First: Force the enemy team to perform the obvious ban. Ban something that goes against your strategy.</li>
<li>Banning Second: Do not reveal your strategy with your ban. Your second ban phase comes after only two hero picks.</li>
<li>1st, 2nd, and 3rd pick: Pick your best or OP heroes.</li>
<li>3rd and 4th pick: Pick your best or OP heroes.</li>
<li>Mid Ban Phase &#8211;
<ol>
<li>Narrow down the role they haven&#8217;t filled yet. Burst and sustain are very easy to cut down.</li>
<li>If team is already solid, remove their XP gain or objective control.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Picking last and making use of information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Basic Positioning &#8211; Too many melee heroes will clog the fight. Too many range heroes will put too much pressure on the tank. There will always be an off tank. Three melee is usually the max.</li>
<li>Count Crowd Control &#8211; Stuns help initiate and finish fights. Make sure your team has at least one. Slows, Roots and Blinds are good too, but you will need at least two stuns.</li>
<li>Counter Pick &#8211; The first three heroes selections should make up the core team (Tank, DPS and Healer). The last two picks should be specific to counter the enemy’s core team.</li>
<li>XP contribution &#8211; The team is extremely solid. Now its time to reinforce it with a global hero (Dahaka, Falstad, Lost Vikings, Abathur or Murk)</li>
</ol>
<p>Draft is Over. Game Starts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change your spec to fill roles that may have been missed.</li>
<li>Stay Alive &#8211; As the game starts, identify who and what ability you are most afraid of. Might be getting grabbed by Diablo, a Nova gank, or getting caught in Jaina&#8217;s Blizzard. Keep mental tally on their movements and cooldowns.</li>
<li>Check Important Talents &#8211; Check your enemy&#8217;s talent picks. Be aware of the builds they are creating. For example, if you are a burst mage, be aware that most heroes get their spell sheilds at level 13. Level 10 spells are also very important to identify before a fight breaks out.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of all the fandoms we celebrate here at GeeklyInc.com, there&#8217;s been rather a dearth of cartoon-horse-related content.  Aside from a little bit of the <a href="https://twitter.com/Bapperson/status/683834737492791296">Tiny Horsies RPG on our Twitch stream</a> (with an <a href="https://twitter.com/FlippydaMan/status/716646362889125888">upcoming special feature at GeeklyCon in June</a>), we haven&#8217;t had much to say about the zeitgeist&#8217;s favorite friendship saga.</p>
<p>But <em>My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</em> <a href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/search/label/Season%206">Season 6 has just started</a>, so it seems as good a time as any to review the <em>My Little Pony Collectible Card Game</em> (MLP CCG), which just so happens to have <a href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2016/04/marks-in-time-cutie-marks-arent-just.html">a new expansion</a> (<em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Enterplayllc/photos/a.370057933089229.87672.357514917676864/1042153972546285/?type=3&amp;theater">Marks in Time</a></em>) due in a little over a month. (Full disclosure: I am an external playtester for the <em>MLP CCG</em>, and did playtest work for <em>Marks in Time</em>.)</p>

<p>What do you get when you combine <em>Friendship Is Magic</em> with the CCG genre? Actually, you get a deep and interesting game that&#8217;s a blast to play and build decks for.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s an Easy Feat (to Play)</strong></p>
<p>The object of the <em>MLP CCG</em> is to solve Problems around Ponyville with the help of your Friends. When you confront Problems (contributing towards solving them), you score points, and the first player to reach 15 points wins the game.</p>
<p>The heart and soul of the game are the Friends, of course, which are the cards that represent the ponies, critters, and other colorful inhabitants of the <em>My Little Pony</em> world:</p>

Friends are also organized into six colors, each themed after one of <em>My Little Pony</em>&#8216;s &#8220;mane six&#8221; characters—purple, white, yellow, orange, blue, and pink. As with most games that feature factional divisions, each color has particular mechanical strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>Some cards have an &#8220;entry requirement&#8221; just below their cost, expressed as a number and a color. If you don&#8217;t have that much power of that color (counting all your Friends in play in the game), you can&#8217;t play those Friends yet. These cards tend to be powerful, but necessitate a commitment to their colors. Usually, you can play two or three colors in a single deck, so you need to make choices about what to prioritize.</p>

These are double-sided cards that start in play on your side and help to define the colors and themes of your deck. They provide some power for meeting entry requirements from the get-go. Over the course of play manes will flip to their &#8220;Boosted&#8221; side, gaining extra power and abilities.</p>

A mane can be a strategic choice, to support a strategy you want to build around, or it can be a personal preference: maybe you really like Lyra or Octavia, and want to make a deck that features them.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn&#8217;t be <em>My Little Pony</em> if you weren&#8217;t going on friendship adventures. In the game, these take the form of Problem cards, which represent the dilemmas your ponies will have to work together to solve. Most Problems are themed after central conflicts or favorite moments from actual episodes:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37228" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_HeavyLifting.jpg" alt="Card_HeavyLifting" width="480" height="344" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_HeavyLifting.jpg 480w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_HeavyLifting-300x215.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_HeavyLifting-298x214.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>Problems have varying confront requirements, shown on the upper and lower edges of the card. You need Friends with that much total power to &#8220;confront&#8221; the problem, which scores you a point at the end of your turn. Confront requirements usually include color, too: in the case of Heavy Lifting, you need two power from a white friend, and two power from another friend that <em>isn&#8217;t</em> white.</p>
<p>Your opponent can also confront the Problem, which is reflected in the &#8220;5&#8221; on the upper border. That 5 can be any color, though your opponent has to bring a little more power to confront the Problem than you do. Usually, your opponent&#8217;s Problem will be more difficult for you to confront, but in the course of play Problems can be blocked off by various cards, so having two Problems presents options and keeps the game moving.</p>
<p>Each player brings a deck of 10 Problems to each game, which are set between the players like so, forming the play locations the game takes place in:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37256" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PlayAreaLayout.jpg" alt="PlayAreaLayout" width="719" height="408" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PlayAreaLayout.jpg 719w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PlayAreaLayout-300x170.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PlayAreaLayout-298x169.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PlayAreaLayout-620x352.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" /></p>
<p>In the diagram above, your &#8220;Home&#8221; is a zone your Friends can stay in when they&#8217;re not at a Problem. During your turn you can move Friends from Home to a Problem and back, if you like. You&#8217;re likewise free to move or play your Friends to either Problem, so you can try to confront your Problem or your opponent&#8217;s (or both).</p>
<p>From time to time, both players will find themselves confronting the same problem at the same time. When that happens, players have a <em>faceoff</em> to see who solves the problem: they add the powers of all their friends at the problem, then each player flips the top card off their deck and adds that card&#8217;s power, as well. Whoever has the highest total wins the faceoff and scores the bonus points shown on the problem. The problem is solved, and a new problem is flipped up from the problem deck. If one player confronts <em>both</em> Problems, there&#8217;s <a href="http://mlpccg.wikia.com/wiki/How_To_Play/Example_Game_(John%27s_Turn_4)">a <em>double problem faceoff</em></a>—an epic fracas where all Friends at all problems compare power to see which player will score bonus points.</p>

Events are the equivalent of spells: they have a one-time effect and then are put into the discard pile. Events can fix colors, draw cards, dismiss friends, or give you a boost in a faceoff. Resources are permanent cards that stay in play on your side and give you a persistent bonus, or an extra ability to use once per turn. Like Friends, Events and Resources sometimes have an entry requirement you&#8217;ll need to meet with the Friends you have in play.</p>

Troublemakers are played to your opponent&#8217;s half of a problem, and block them from confronting it until the Troublemaker is dismissed, defeated, or otherwise bypassed. They&#8217;re not insurmountable, but can give you a few turns to get a few points ahead. Sometimes, they&#8217;ll give your opponent a point or two when they&#8217;re defeated, for the trouble they made. Rare Troublemakers called <em>Villains</em> send Friends scrambling for cover and can block <em>both</em> players from confronting a problem.</p>
<p>Players pay for all these fun cards with <em>action tokens</em> (AT). At the beginning of each of their turns, a player gets a few more AT to spend. AT don&#8217;t go away from turn to turn (unlike mana in <strong>Magic</strong> or <strong>Hearthstone</strong>), so you can &#8220;bank&#8221; them to save up for more expensive cards.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-37282" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ScoreSliderCard_RockNRave-215x300.jpg" alt="ScoreSliderCard_RockNRave" width="215" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ScoreSliderCard_RockNRave-215x300.jpg 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ScoreSliderCard_RockNRave-298x416.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ScoreSliderCard_RockNRave.jpg 344w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /> <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-37283" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TurnCard_RockNRave-215x300.jpg" alt="TurnCard_RockNRave" width="215" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TurnCard_RockNRave-215x300.jpg 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TurnCard_RockNRave-298x416.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TurnCard_RockNRave.jpg 344w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></p>
<p>As players score more points, they get higher amounts of AT each turn, so the number of things they can do increases. (The two cards pictured lay on top of each other to help players keep track of their current score and how much AT players should receive.) AT gain makes for a nice pacing mechanic: the game starts slowly, but speeds up toward the end, and players get to feel more powerful each step of the way.</p>
<p>AT can also be used for a few other game actions, pictured on the Turn Card: drawing cards, moving Friends between problems, and so on. Often, playing cards from your hand will be your best choice, but it&#8217;s nice to have options. In particular, if you aren&#8217;t able to play a card on a given turn, spending AT to draw means you don&#8217;t feel completely helpless.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s the game in a nutshell: play Friends, confront Problems, score points. Help your friends with Resources and Events. Hinder your opponents with Troublemakers. How does the game stack up? Honestly, it&#8217;s pretty great.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing, Kindness</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-37292" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Event_TrueTrueFriend-215x300.jpg" alt="Event_TrueTrueFriend" width="215" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Event_TrueTrueFriend-215x300.jpg 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Event_TrueTrueFriend-298x416.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Event_TrueTrueFriend.jpg 344w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" />Thematically, the game does a great job expressing the overall sentiment of the <em>My Little Pony</em> show. This is a challenge for a 1v1 card game, where player interaction necessarily involves removing your opponent&#8217;s cards from play. Part of this is linguistic: Friends aren&#8217;t &#8220;destroyed&#8221; or &#8220;sacrificed,&#8221; but rather &#8220;dismissed&#8221; or &#8220;retired.&#8221; On a deeper level, the game avoids direct conflict between the players and their Friends. Even when you&#8217;re in a faceoff, you&#8217;re really just competing to see who is solving the Problem <em>more</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Problems almost always require two Friends to confront (and usually require two different colors of Friends), which makes the game feel like it&#8217;s <em>about</em> teamwork in a fundamental way. Friends with different attributes have to work together. It&#8217;s the only way things get done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Beautiful Heart</strong></p>
<p>Strategically, I&#8217;ve found the game to be an interesting twist from <strong>Magic</strong> and other CCGs. There&#8217;s a surprising amount of mechanical complexity, both in terms of individual cards, which are often sophisticated designs, and combinations of multiple cards working together. Members of our playtest group have put together some pretty intricate combo decks, which is really only possible when the developers put powerful tools in the players&#8217; hands. Decks built around a single mechanic, card, or theme, feel as cohesive as any I&#8217;ve played in a CCG.</p>
<p>Various aspects of the design are subtly impressive, particularly how the flow of the game helps keep play competitive. The gradual boosting of action tokens as the game progresses, for example, serves as an elegant catch-up mechanic. Once one player hits the point threshold for increasing AT awards, both players get that much AT at the start of each of their turns. So, if your opponent gets off to a fast start and scores 2 points before you score any, you&#8217;ll get the first crack at a turn with 3 AT, to help you get back in the game. Similarly, if you force a face-off, your opponent will have first crack at the fresh Problem(s), so they can score a point or two to try to keep pace.</p>
<p><strong>Faithful and Strong</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say everything&#8217;s perfect. Some of the game&#8217;s best cards can be oppressively powerful, and the high-level tournament metagame is pretty different from what most people would play on their kitchen tables (to a certain extent, that&#8217;s the nature of CCGs). Playing against some strategies, especially strong Troublemaker decks, can feel a little hopeless. The nature of point scoring, which naturally limits the number of points a player can score in a turn, can make it hard for aggressive strategies to put the game away. And sometimes, the best way to fight a certain strategy is to find a card that turns it off entirely.</p>

<p>But a lot of these issues can be circumvented in a supportive play group. <em>MLP CCG </em>is a deep, rewarding game with a lot of cool decks to build and a lot of neat interactions to explore, and a convivial group can give each player</p>
<p><strong>Big Adventure</strong></p>
<p>This is actually a pretty great time to get into the game, since recent sets (<em>Absolute Discord</em>, <em>Equestrian Odysseys</em>, and <em>High Magic</em>) have really been killing it. They reflect a lot of great choices that make the game more fun for more players. (For the reconrd, these are sets that were finished before I started playtesting.)</p>

Recent sets have also featured a host of multicolor cards, many of which inspire new decks. These cards show up at accessible rarities, so newer players have a good chance of finding them. Honest to goodness, <em>MLP CCG </em>is among the best games I&#8217;ve seen for spreading powerful cards down to common and uncommon.</p>
<p>The developers also recently announced a change to the way Problem bonus points work, <a href="http://team-pandeponium.horse/?p=626">which makes it more strategically attractive to induce Faceoffs with your opponent</a>. Faceoffs are the most exciting moments of the game, and they&#8217;re one of the things new players are drawn to because they seem like (and are) fun. Rewarding attractive, exciting plays is a great step.</p>
<p>All in all, it&#8217;s a great time to get started. <em>MLP CCG</em>, incidentally, has excellent intro decks; they play well against other intro products out of the box, include a number of powerful cards, and offer clear directions for improvement. Oh, and the sets draft well, too—our group likes to draft four packs for each player, and add a few copies of <a href="http://ponyhead.com/cards/hm84/kevin-fitting-in">Kevin, Fitting In</a> at the end of the draft to help fix colors.</p>
<p><strong>Tons of Fun</strong></p>
<p><em>MLP CCG </em>is a game with a lot of heart and a lot of love. The card concepting is stellar; the creative team does a great job of capturing the show&#8217;s most iconic moments and most beloved characters. Many of the cards&#8217; subtitles and flavor texts are legitimately funny, full of winks and nods at inside jokes from the <em>My Little Pony</em> fandom and other popular shows.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-37235" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_SpecialBeamCannon-215x300.jpg" alt="Card_SpecialBeamCannon" width="215" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_SpecialBeamCannon-215x300.jpg 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_SpecialBeamCannon-298x416.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_SpecialBeamCannon.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /> <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-37234" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Bloomception-215x300.jpg" alt="Card_Bloomception" width="215" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Bloomception-215x300.jpg 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Bloomception-298x416.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Card_Bloomception.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /> <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-37243" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Friend_LyraAndBonBonBetterHalves-215x300.jpg" alt="Friend_LyraAndBonBonBetterHalves" width="215" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Friend_LyraAndBonBonBetterHalves-215x300.jpg 215w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Friend_LyraAndBonBonBetterHalves-298x416.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Friend_LyraAndBonBonBetterHalves.jpg 344w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" />Favorite characters like Lyra, Bon Bon, and Dr. Hooves, who tend not to get much screen time in the show, have several cards each. (There are also plenty of cards for the mane six, so fans who are excited to play with their favorite characters will have no trouble.) Somehow, the game strikes the right balance of appreciating the passionate fan following <em>MLP</em> has found outside its target demographic, while not making the IP <em>about</em> those fans.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Makes It All Complete</strong></p>
<p>That might be the best compliment one can give to a game like this: given the IP it&#8217;s representing, it would have been easy to make a silly card game for kids to cash in a quick buck. Instead, the designers turned out a robust game that can stand alongside the giants of the genre. <em>MLPCCG</em> would be a good game even without the My Little Pony flavor overlay. Add a little <em>Friendship</em>, though, and you&#8217;ve got some real magic.</p>
<p><em>My Little Pony Collectible Card Game </em><em>is designed and developed by Enterplay, LLC, which licenses the My Little Pony IP from Hasbro. Packs have an MSRP of $3.50, and intro decks have an MSRP of $10.99. Players require a 45-card main deck, a 10-card problem deck, and a Mane character to play.</em></p>

<p>Well, here we are &#8211; the release of <em>Dark Soul III</em>. I am scared. I am ready. I will Die. A lot. But, I have resigned myself to this fate since I deserve to die over and over again. Yes, having bought <em>Dark Souls III</em> means that I have no excuse for my dozens of digital deaths. I have made my choice and now you can watch me reap the consequences. Hurrah!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">*<strong>Spoiler Free</strong>* also possibly *<strong>a wee bit NSFW</strong>*</p>
<hr />
<p>Never heard of <em>Yurikuma Arashi</em>? It’s from the rather brilliant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunihiko_Ikuhara">Kunihiko Ikuhara</a>, who directed some of the best episodes of <em>Sailor Moon</em> and was the series director for <em>Sailor Moon R</em>, <em>S</em>, and <em>SuperS</em>. He then left Toei due to the restrictions placed on his artistic vision, and went on to form his own production company to create <em><a href="http://geeklyinc.com/transformation-sequence-episode-59-revolutionary-girl-utena-part-1/">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em>. Ikuhara is generally known for his creative and boundary-pushing portrayals of homosexual relationships.</p>
<p>This might go some way to explain why his most recent project’s title translates to “Lesbian Bear Storm“. Yes, this is one of the gayest anime shows ever made and it’s fantastic. First of all, I won’t be going into any plot twists of <em>Yurikuma Arashi</em>,but only commenting on the overall themes and aesthetics, so it’ll be as spoiler free as possible. That being said, here’s the general gist of the show.</p>
<p><em>Bears have grown sentient and violent. After a vicious war between bears and humans, the humans begin construction on a Wall of Severance to segregate themselves from the bears for eternity. Enter Kureha, a teenager who despises bears after her mother was killed by one who managed to infiltrate the wall, who is currently in a relationship with fellow student Sumika. Two new students join her class in Arashigaoka School, Ginko and Lulu, who are secretly bears in disguise, who intend to eat the humans around them. Can Kureha face the Invisible Storm pressing down upon her?</em></p>
<p>Boy HOWDY does that synopsis not do the series justice. That’s essentially the first 5 minutes of the show, if anything.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-37199 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3.png" alt="3" width="1000" height="554" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3.png 1000w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3-300x166.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3-768x425.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3-298x165.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3-620x343.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><em>Yurikuma Arashi</em> is all about lesbians. If any character has romantic or sexual feelings towards another in this anime, it’s between two women. In fact, the world is almost entirely populated by women it seems, which is symbolic in that there is no <em>male gaze</em> in this show. This comes to the very heart of what Ikuhara is attempting to do with <em>Yurikuma Arashi.</em></p>
<p>“Yuri&#8221; relationships (lesbian romance) in mainstream anime are nearly always an object of titillation, while at the same time presented with a strange lack of legitimacy. <em>Yurikuma Arashi</em>, on the other hand, feels as though it’s trying to address this paradox. There is light nudity in this show, but it’s never framed in an erotic “ecchi” fashion. The usual titillation of nudity is framed like renaissance art, but primarily the show treats its characters with respect, and abstains from objectifying them.</p>
<p>The imagery is purposefully provocative as a parody of the genre it’s skewering – you certainly step back and say “WOW I can’t BELIEVE they drew that”, but the plot puts these images into a thoughtful context. The result is beautiful and yet, it certainly does not deny that a large part of attraction is physical.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-37200 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/4.gif" alt="4" width="540" height="304" /></p>
<p>In fact, when it’s the characters in the show objectifying other characters as a target of pure lust, it serves as a commentary for those viewers guilty of it. All this sounds like pretty heavy-handed symbolism, and, in fact, it IS laid on rather thick, but that never gets in the way of how enjoyable the show is to watch. The symbolism is purposefully heavy, along with the religious aesthetics in the show &#8211; it creates a sense of the Divine not only in the abstract lore of <em>Yurikuma Arashi</em>, but also in the relationships between characters.</p>
<p>Femininity and homosexuality are celebrated, much in the way that Ikuhara used to both in <em>Sailor Moon</em> and<em> Revolutionary Girl Utena</em>. We can see the influence that these series had on Ikuhara&#8217;s later works, and the developing arc of his oeuvre is an essay in itself. It&#8217;s fascinating to watch. Ikuhara worked on <em>Sailor Moon</em> during Zoisite and Kunzite’s strange intimacies. He was series director for Fish-Eye’s flamboyant cross-dressing and overt homosexuality. And most comparable, of course, is his directorship of <em>Sailor Moon S</em>, the core relationship there being between Michiru and Haruka.</p>
<p>While the manga of Sailor Moon certainly introduced these women as a couple, it’s undeniable that the series of <em>Sailor Moon S</em> deepened the relationship between them. They had more time, for one thing. What’s important to note that, even in a time where gay relationships were seen as a curio in anime (to this very day, even), Michiru and Haruka consistently felt real, deep, and full of unstated meaning. The series did not shy away from the fact that these women loved each other both emotionally and physically. In other words, they respected these characters and their relationship.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-37206 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10.png" alt="10" width="1000" height="555" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10.png 1000w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10-300x167.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10-768x426.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10-298x165.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10-620x344.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Then, in <em>Utena</em>, Ikuhara continued what was obviously becoming a core focus of his creativity: gender and sexuality studies. Again, his approach to exploring these subjects is extremely humanist, never preachy, and seeks to normalize homosexuality and female empowerment while also skewering patriarchal values in a surprisingly sympathetic light. Give a listen to the <em>Utena</em> reviews on Transformation Sequence for more of a breakdown.</p>
<p>But never mind the heavy stuff, how enjoyable of a show is <em>Yurukuma Arashi</em> to just kick back and watch? Well, <em>very</em>.</p>
<p>This is a very funny show, first and foremost. The main character of Kureha serves as a humorless straight-man in a completely absurd world filled with cute, deadly bears, but the camera is never mugging for a joke, relying on hackneyed “comic” gaffs used ad nauseum in other anime. The plot takes itself seriously, even while patently being deeply comedic. The result is a neat marriage between pathos and humor, gravity and levity.</p>
<p>Ginko and Lulu, the central bears of the show, are both lovable and a little terrifying. As bears, they’re stupidly cute and this humorously undercuts how dangerous they really are. Along with Kureha, they’re fantastic protagonists – I swiftly find myself identifying with all their loves, loneliness, and longing. They all have complex, dynamic personalities, and undergo satisfying character development.</p>
<p>The show also looks lovely. Every character looks perfect and delicate, swathed in a strange pastel glow. The colors really make this all feel like a fairy tail in a pop-up book, something that becomes more poignant as the show progresses. This helps with the strange narrative style here, as it makes the incoherent seem wonderfully meaningful.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-37205 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/9.gif" alt="9" width="500" height="280" /></p>
<p>In fact, everything seems pregnant with symbolism and direct statements are continually avoided. Rather than being an overt deconstruction of how homosexuality is treated by Japanese society, it speaks of prejudice and segregation in general, of the lust, the logistics, and the beauty of love, of the disparity between obsession and devotion. Best of all, it leaves the viewer to arrive at their own conclusions, right up until the very end.</p>
<p>It’s not perfect, of course – the narrative seems rather disjointed in the first half, as though it’s not quite sure where it wants to go. There are some elements that I wish I could have had just a touch more time with, and while it’s reasonably paced for a 12-episode show, some of the developments earlier on could have been condensed. A few episodes in, I was completely baffled about, well, pretty much everything; unsure whether it was an exploitative piece of trash or a work of genius that went over my head.</p>
<p>As the show went on, however, I saw Ikuhara re-framing the exploration of the perceptions of homosexuality in Japanese media. That’s only one entry point in his narrative in <em>Yurikuma</em>, but ultimately, the message seems to be that, no matter how much society at large tries to ignore homosexuality, or worse be, actively hostile against, love in its own right transcends normative values and societal boundaries, and is all the more beautiful for it.</p>
<p>In a way, it’s both genius and trash, and it’s all the stronger for it. I could totally understand why someone would not like this show. It definitely feels niche and certainly it doesn’t demand attention on the level of, say, <em>Noragami</em> (upon which I dote), but ever since I finished <em>Yurikuma Arashi</em>, I just can’t stop thinking about how wonderful and weird and down-right kitschy it all is.</p>
<p>Go watch <em>Yurikuma Arashi</em> – I hope it’ll stick with you as much as it did me.</p>
<p>Also, have a watch of the opening. I feel like it perfectly encapsulates the softness and the absurdity of <em>Yurikuma</em>. Probably not safe to watch at work, I suspect.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Living Campaign is a series of articles where every author has an impact on the world. Articles can focus on any part of the setting, from locations to NPCs or even events. Writers can add new elements to the world or they can build upon what already has been defined. This will be a system-agnostic series, meaning that it will provide flavor and content instead of stat blocks and monster entries.</p>
<p>The intent of this series is to provide inspiration for home games. It will draw on foundational elements from Lovecraftian fiction as well as the horror and urban fantasy genres. The ideas presented can be utilized individually, or as a whole. As the setting develops and evolves, special articles will feature story lines within the established world. But all of the content in this series is simply fodder for additional development.</p>
<p>The specific boundaries and details of this campaign setting are intentionally vague. This is done so that all contributors have absolute freedom to create whatever they wish. Authors can add in any geographic details they want, from coastlines to mountains. The city itself might contain a university, manufacturing plants, shipping docks, or any number of physical locations. The general location and time frame will be the United States in the 1920s. However, the nature of this genre lends itself to a certain flexibility. Anything can, and might, happen.</p>
<p>And with the introduction complete…welcome to New Coventry.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coventry Conversation-Location</span></p>
<p>The Conversation is the city&#8217;s primary newspaper. It&#8217;s located on Main Street, at the canter of downtown. The building itself fits the bill with an appearance with those of the time period. It has three floors, which is fairly large compared to the rest of the city. When you first walk through the massive double doors, you are greeted with a smiling receptionist who will take calls and give messages to the various members of the staff. Next to her desk is another, smaller, set of double doors that leads to where the stairs and a majority of the staff offices are located. Behind the staff desks is the break room and the door to the basement where the printing press is housed.</p>
<p>A quick adventure up the stairs and you&#8217;ll find yourself in a hallway with multiple doors on either side; the offices of the head staff such as editors and photographers are located here. The chief editor&#8217;s office is here as well. At the end of the hallway is a another set of stairs that would lead to the third and final floor of the Conversation. This floor is one giant storage room. Each wall is lined with filing cabinets. In the middle of the room are tables and chairs. At any given time you can see archives of older editions of the newspapers scattered about the surface.</p>
<p>The staff of the Conversation are a standard group of people. Most of the reporters and all of the editors are men. Sprinkled among them are some women. Most are receptionists, but a few of them have shown quite the talent for writing, photography and other positions associated with being a member of the press. The overall atmosphere of the place is usually very cheery and seems like it would be a nice place to work. That&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t some corrupt members in the staff.</p>

<p>If you have ever found yourself asking these questions and more, you&#8217;ve come to the right place. Hi, my name is Kym and I am here to gently lead you by the hand into the magical world of anime. Think of me as your cool anime professor because I&#8217;m about to sit on my chair backwards and expand your minds through Japanese cartoons.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go ahead and start by asking the obvious question:</p>
<p><strong>What is anime?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, it&#8217;s animation from Japan. To really get a feel for what the genre means as a whole, let&#8217;s all hop in our time machines and take a brief look at the history of anime.</p>
<p>If you want to place the blame for the creation of anime on any one person, it would be Walt Disney. From around 1910 up until the beginning of WWII, animation in Japan was heavily influenced by foreign markets, both in the audience&#8217;s expectations, as well as the emerging style of the time. Additionally, since Disney had already made money back home, their films were sold <em>extremely </em>cheaply in Japan, meaning, in order to compete, Japanese animation studios had to produce their works on a very small budget.</p>
<div id="attachment_37137" style="width: 701px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37137 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WHY-WALT.jpg" alt="THIS IS YOUR FAULT, WALT." width="691" height="345" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WHY-WALT.jpg 691w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WHY-WALT-300x150.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WHY-WALT-298x149.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WHY-WALT-620x310.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">THIS IS YOUR FAULT, WALT.</p></div>
<p>Most studios back in 1930 used mainly cutout animation (yes, like <em>South Park</em>) because their manpower and resources were so limited. However, this doesn&#8217;t mean that it was all garbage. Animators Yasuji Murata and Noburō Ōfuji were able to produce some amazing works using this simple technique.</p>
<div class="video"><iframe width="620" height="465" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/drq0rhFdvtY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>However, two dudes by the name of Kenzo Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo stepped the collective Japanese animation game up by formally introducing concepts like cel animation, music, and multiplane cameras. Masaoka and Seo created the first &#8220;talkie&#8221; animation, <em>Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka</em>, in 1933, as well as the first entirely cel shaded anime, <em>The Dance of the Chagamas</em>, in 1934. This technology was expensive as heck, though, so these early animations were generally short PR films sponsored by various companies or propaganda paid for by the government.</p>
<p>Mitsuyo Seo worked on several of these propaganda films during WWII &#8211; the most famous of which involves a character named Momotaro (a hero from Japanese folklore) bombing Pearl Harbor with various cute cartoon animals. This is considered to be Japan&#8217;s first feature-length animated film (clocking in at around 37 minutes), and was produced by the newly re-founded Shochiku Corporation, which still exists today. Interestingly enough, the President of Shochiku was arrested post WWII for war crimes due to his part in the creation of this film.</p>
<div id="attachment_37156" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37156 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hqdefault-1.jpg" alt="Still from &quot;Momotarō no Umiwashi&quot; Huh...." width="480" height="360" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hqdefault-1.jpg 480w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hqdefault-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hqdefault-1-298x224.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Still from <strong>Momotarō no Umiwashi</strong><br /> Huh&#8230;.</p></div>
<p>However, the most bizarre propaganda film to come from this time period is a short directed by Komatsuzawa Hajime, which depicts an evil Mickey Mouse raining death from the skies until he is defeated by Momotaro (again &#8211; Momotaro was big back then, which is surprising  for a dude whose name means &#8220;Peach Boy&#8221;).</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/icVu-acHlpU">https://youtu.be/icVu-acHlpU</a></p>
<p>In 1948, Toei Animation was officially founded. They would later give us the first &#8220;true&#8221; anime in 1958 with <em>The Tale of the White Serpent</em> &#8211; Japan&#8217;s first full color animated feature film. Anime hadn&#8217;t yet come into its own at this point in time, and a lot of the film was heavily mopped from Disney feature films, with musical numbers and cute animal sidekicks.</p>
<div id="attachment_37157" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37157 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/didney.jpg" alt="Though Disney would later return the favor. " width="730" height="495" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/didney.jpg 730w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/didney-300x203.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/didney-298x202.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/didney-620x420.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Though Disney would later return the favor.</p></div>
<p>Toei would later go on to produce some little-known indie series such as Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, and One Piece.</p>
<p>In the early stages of their career, they focused very heavily on allowing each individual director take their projects in whatever direction they wished. Their collaboration with Isao Takahata on <em>The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun</em> would later set the stage for directors like Hayao Miyazaki (<em>Spirited Away</em>, <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>, <em>Princess Mononoke</em>) and Mamoru Oshii (<em>Urusei Yatsura</em>, <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, <em>Patlabor</em>).</p>
<p>In 1961 Mushi Productions was founded by Osamu Tezuka aka creator of <em>Astro Boy</em><strong> </strong>aka the Grandaddy of Manga. Tezuka was previously working at Toei, but as soon as his contract expired, he wanted to found a production house of his own.</p>
<div id="attachment_37164" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37164 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Osamu-Tezuka-intro.jpg" alt="Look at this cheeky beret-wearing goober." width="600" height="425" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Osamu-Tezuka-intro.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Osamu-Tezuka-intro-300x213.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Osamu-Tezuka-intro-298x211.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Look at this cheeky beret-wearing goober.</p></div>
<p>Tezuka began his career as a manga artist, and it was mainly his influence that brought about the Golden Age of comics in Japan post WWII. He originally became interested in animation as a teenager after seeing the previously mentioned Mitsuyo Seo propaganda film, <em>Momotarō no Umiwashi</em>.</p>
<p>Mushi Productions pioneered TV anime in Japan, with series like <em>Astro Boy</em>,<em> Kimba the White Lion</em>, and <em>Princess Knight</em>. These shows were some of the first to make the jump from Japan to the US, though Tezuka was reportedly pissed about the alterations made due to US censorship laws.</p>
<p>The &#8220;big eyes&#8221; anime style that persists even today was invented by Tezuka, who himself was drawing inspiration from Western animation like <em>Betty Boop</em>, and other Disney films.</p>
<div id="attachment_37168" style="width: 826px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37168 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WALT-WHY.jpg" alt="WHY DID YOU DO THIS WALT" width="816" height="261" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WALT-WHY.jpg 816w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WALT-WHY-300x96.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WALT-WHY-768x246.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WALT-WHY-298x95.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WALT-WHY-620x198.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">WHY DID YOU DO THIS WALT</p></div>
<p>This concludes our first lesson! Next week we&#8217;ll be looking at anime from the 60&#8217;s onward, so prep your buns for lots and lots of mech anime.</p>
<p>よくできました~! Class dismissed!</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Ben here with my Transformation Sequence hat on! A couple of times a week, I hope to hit you all up with some first impressions of different shows that we might not have time to cover on the podcast. My measurement for a &#8216;first impression&#8217; of a show means at least the first three episodes are watched, since that is the average amount of time needed to introduce the main characters, the world, and the driving conflict in a story. This also means some slight spoilers for the beginning of shows, but I will try to keep them to a minimum. Today, I want to let you all know about Schwarzesmarken.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-37131 aligncenter" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/03/Schwar-banner.png" alt="Schwar banner" width="512" height="226" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/03/Schwar-banner.png 512w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/03/Schwar-banner-300x132.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/03/Schwar-banner-298x132.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p>This is a mech show set in an alternate history setting while Germany was still split into East and West. We follow the top mech unit, the 666th TSF squadron &#8216;Black Marks,&#8217; as they fight off the aliens as well as endure some political backstabbing. We follow Theodor Eberbach, our sullen anime boy mech pilot, as he is ordered by their tough-as-nails commander, Irisdina Bernhard, to protect fellow pilot and recent defector from the other side of the Berlin Wall, Katia Waldheim.</p>
<p>This all sounds pretty neat, right? Alternate history stories always intrigue me. It&#8217;s taking a familiar setting where you don&#8217;t have to world build as hard, but you can get as crazy with it as you want. The crazy they go with is big robots that pretty people pilot, with a layer of political intrigue? This all sounds too good to be true, and to a certain extent it is. Schwarzesmarken sadly falls prey to some less than desirable anime tropes early on that definitely gave me some pause as to whether or not I would continue watching it. Sadly, it&#8217;s not just narrative tropes but character design ones as well.</p>
<div id="attachment_37140" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-37140 size-full" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/schwarzesmarken-1.jpg" alt="schwarzesmarken-1" width="640" height="360" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/schwarzesmarken-1.jpg 640w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/schwarzesmarken-1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/schwarzesmarken-1-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/schwarzesmarken-1-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">This is me watching this show.</p></div>
<p>First, lets talk about the good stuff because there is plenty to like. They don&#8217;t pull punches on the violence and gore. When these aliens get their hands on a person, it is game over in a nasty way. It&#8217;s reminiscent of <em>Attack on Titan</em> in that sense, but instead of swords, our heroes have <em>Armored Core</em> looking mechs. The actual plot is passable and the performances are fine. It&#8217;s nothing special, but it&#8217;s serviceable enough to the action. The thing that struck me the most about this show is the decision to lean heavy into CG animation for the mechs and aliens. After having seen so many other shows have terrible CG work in them, this was a pleasant surprise because it doesn&#8217;t look like total trash! The alien&#8217;s designs are already creepy enough as it is, but with CG they stand out more as the horrors that they are. The mechs even look fine, though there is something about the way they turn that doesn&#8217;t look good to me.</p>
<div id="attachment_37142" style="width: 624px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-37142" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tank_Class_BETA.png" alt="So icky!" width="614" height="527" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tank_Class_BETA.png 614w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tank_Class_BETA-300x257.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tank_Class_BETA-298x256.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">So icky!</p></div>
<p>Now, on to the bad: this show is just dripping with fan service. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with that term, it just means that the girls are over proportioned and often scantily dressed. Apparently, if aliens came from the moon to kill us all, only women with a bust size that not even a German military uniform can contain are our only hope. Which is another thing that just twists the knife that this show has stuck in me. I love how they have women at the heads of these military organizations! Sadly, they are either half naked, or wearing skin tight body suits, so they might as well be naked. Every opportunity this show gets to focus on cleavage, it does. A little fan service here and there doesn&#8217;t bother me, as I can usually ignore it, but it is put front and center in this show.</p>
<div id="attachment_37144" style="width: 677px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-37144" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Schwarzesmarken-02-e1454618753772.jpg" alt="You can tell who is the most important here" width="667" height="375" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Schwarzesmarken-02-e1454618753772.jpg 667w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Schwarzesmarken-02-e1454618753772-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Schwarzesmarken-02-e1454618753772-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Schwarzesmarken-02-e1454618753772-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">You can tell who is the most important here</p></div>
<p>This show had a lot of promise on paper for me. Mech anime with female leads, nasty aliens, and gore ridden violence are the ingredients to my powerpuff self. Sadly, the blatant fan service that is not only over used, but practically relied on for the audiences continued watching experience, puts a sour taste in my mouth. I would have to say give this show a pass.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lucifer has been renewed. I don&#8217;t want to live on this planet anymore. But this was an off-week for a few of the worst shows, so that&#8217;s some solace.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blindspot &#8211; Any Wounded Thief<img class="size-medium wp-image-37125 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hqdefault-300x225.jpg" alt="hqdefault" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hqdefault-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hqdefault-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hqdefault.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
This episode started with a lot of forced drama. From the usage of past emotional scenes to the discussion in the conference room, everything was clearly done to create a tense tone. The showdown with the general came early and was resolved way too quickly. He went from rationalization to confession in seconds. I understand that his part was not the ultimate climax of the episode, but poor writing made him nothing but necessary exposition and weakened his role instead of making him an interesting character. This episode also featured a lot of stupid moments. The shock on the face of Chang after she shot into the container of gas canisters was laughable. The fact that the team happened to pick the right location towards the end was logical within the confines of the show, but was typical plot-driven necessity. What&#8217;s really interesting about this episode is the fact that the crime of the week was pushed to the background so that events could focus on the personal drama of the characters. This is a refreshing break from the typical format of Blindspot, but it should&#8217;ve happened much earlier in the course of this season. Doing it this late in the game makes it feel like a forced move to attract attention instead of a careful plan to engage the audience during the natural progress of the show. I really liked Jane&#8217;s flashbacks. Even though they frustratingly did not reveal anything about the mystery, they were not simply based off a reaction she had to an event. It reflects her slow recovery, which I appreciate. The choice with Patterson is starting to worry me. I have liked her character the best and it seems like her story is being directed towards a break down. It would be interesting, but I don&#8217;t know if it would be handled properly. Lastly, has anyone else noticed that the weird white room with a wall of lights set has been getting a lot of use lately? That&#8217;s just weird.</p>

I feel much better after the exposition between Major and Ravi. I love this bromance and clearing the problems that have existed between them for ages is like deeply inhaling after holding my breath for way too long. Amnesia Blane was very entertaining. As was Business Savvy Don-E. As was Zombie Major jumping into the brain of the week game. Really, every part of this episode was solid and perfect. Next week is the two part season finale, so it makes sense that the quality and excitement is ramping up. And that ending! Wow! That’s a perfect way to get the audience on the edge of its seat for next week. Overall, this was a tight, well-written episode. It highlighted the humor that is the show&#8217;s strength. It focused on the advancement of the main plot while still featuring character changes and development. Most importantly, it made me eager for the next episodes. This is not just because of the cliff hanger ending. Every scene in this episode included interesting, unresolved moments that created a true sense of desire for their resolution. This episode was a perfect balance of everything that <em>iZombie</em> does well. As the end of this season draws near, I must admit that I have been missing the jokes that are focused on Liv&#8217;s cooking. I am disappointed in myself. I always say how much I love those cooking montages. I&#8217;ve just never caught the jokes. That&#8217;s a credit to the writers for working in such subtle, smart humor. I&#8217;m just very bad at puns.</p>

I really wanted to enjoy this episode. The Lucifer/Castiel combo is always entertaining. But Rowena is back because of plot. And just like always, she&#8217;s playing both sides and being more than a title annoying. The jump of logic from &#8220;we have no chance against Amara&#8221; to &#8220;the horn is the only thing that can stop her&#8221; is typical late-game <em>Supernatural</em> shenanigans. It doesn&#8217;t make sense but logic tends to fall apart when a McGuffin hunt is in play. And of course, it didn&#8217;t work. There were a lot of almost good moments in this episode, but the overall presentation simply fell short because, like so many other Supernatural episodes, nothing happened. The only bit of new information is that Amara is trying to coax out God for a showdown. That&#8217;s potentially interesting. As deeply as this show has dug into all kinds of religious myths, it has never revealed its version of God. <em>Supernatural</em> is grounded in the classic Christian mythology (with a heavy helping of everything else out there) and has relied on the concepts of Heaven, Hell, Demons, and Angels since the pilot episode. But it has always played the &#8220;God&#8217;s not around&#8221; card. It&#8217;s very possible that this character has shown up before (if the fan theories are true) but it&#8217;s never been clear. Adding a God character to Supernatural would prove interesting. It could take the show in a new direction. But it could cause just as many problems. After all, if God shows up, he could very easily just become a quest-giver instead of an interesting character. I really have no idea where Supernatural is going to go in these last few episodes. All I do know is that Heaven seems to shop exclusively at Gap in the late 90s.</p>

For all my best efforts, the surprise reveal of this episode was spoiled before I watched it happen. That doesn&#8217;t have as much of a negative impact as you&#8217;d expect because the show made what was going to happen very clear. (I&#8217;m still going to avoid spoiling it in this article, just in case. See, I am a nice guy.) But since the cemetery scene did not happen yet, that still might relate to something else. And <em>Arrow</em> is known for secrets, lies, and betrayals. This very episode focused on all of those elements. And with that cut away right before the final moments, I can&#8217;t help but think that some sort of trickery is in place. But that being said, I enjoy a good character death. It demonstrates that the show writers are not afraid to do drastic things. While this death might not have been the most heroic, it was dramatic and emotional. However, what did it really do for the plot? It didn&#8217;t serve as a motivator for the heroes. They were already united against Darhk. And it didn&#8217;t serve to identify Darhk as a villain or demonstrate his motives. It was certainly cast in this light, but it wasn&#8217;t necessary. The show has taken plenty of care to show Darhk as ruthless and dedicated to his cause. The line about being a man of his word was the only justification of this action. And it was weak. As much as I hate to say it, this was a pointless death that was only included to increase the drama of the season. I think the character deserved better. Many people were not happy with the casting and performance of this character, but I have always been a fan of both the source material and the version in <em>Arrow</em>. I am not sad at the death, but I think it could&#8217;ve been much better. That being said, it was a very comic book moment. Actually, the majority of this episode was pure comic book. Oliver saying how Merlyn would break into the lair just before it happened, the Diggle/Oliver showdown over Andy, and Andy&#8217;s betrayal were all scenes pretty much ripped from the pages of any comic book. <em>Arrow</em> might not have started the trend of comic book shows on television, but it was the first (in my opinion) to prove the success and quality of the genre. It&#8217;s nice to see episodes like this that throw back to the source material.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Legends of Tomorrow &#8211; Progeny<img class="size-medium wp-image-37133 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legends-of-Tomorrow-110-300x169.jpg" alt="Legends-of-Tomorrow-110" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legends-of-Tomorrow-110-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legends-of-Tomorrow-110-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legends-of-Tomorrow-110-298x167.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legends-of-Tomorrow-110-620x348.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legends-of-Tomorrow-110.jpg 970w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
Too much happened in this episode. It wasn&#8217;t bad, but nothing got the attention it deserved. But this is a typical event in comic books, so it isn&#8217;t that bad. It&#8217;s just a shame that when the show tried to discuss more important topics, they got lost in the chaos. It&#8217;s also a shame that such a wonderful special guest casting got dumped into a relatively pointless role. This was still a good episode, it just wasn&#8217;t great. Even the big fight scene at the end, something that <em>Legends</em> normally does very well, fell short. And the inclusion of the new threat at the end felt like it was shoehorned in at the last minute. I think it happened only to get Rory back into the action. In general, the show should’ve picked one thing to focus on. I’ve said before that the discussion of fate and the philosophy of ‘the good of the many outweighs the needs of the few” are really interesting and important topics to discuss. I like what the show is doing with these concepts so far, but I’d like less angst and drama and more actual discussion. I know, I know, this is not the format for such a thing, but it’s not happening anywhere else. Since the show has taken on the weight of this type of topic, it should devote more energy to it. It could have, for example, dumped Kendra’s flashbacks. What did they really do for the plot? The answer isn’t hard…it’s nothing. And they didn’t even help her character develop at all. She is still the same ill-defined character that’s important only because she’s part of the plot. I like the fact that the team (for the most part) united against Rip about murder. And I like the fact that he ultimately changed his mind. It was the right thing, both morally and for the sake of the plot. Rip is bad at his job, but he can’t become a villain. And murder generally pushes characters over that line. I like that Ray got a little time in the spotlight for more than simply having a super suit. As an actor, he can handle a lot more screen time than he’s getting now. Hopefully, he will remain with the team as the next season comes around and take on a larger role. Ray seems to have an impact on history, so I would like to see that explored. I also want to see a more clearly-defined plot. So far, it’s just  been the team jumping around to random points in the time line that have interesting sets for the crew to build. The plot of “chase down Savage” isn’t working to sustain the show because the team never really succeeds at anything. On one hand, this goes to prove the difficulty of their task, which makes the show interesting. On the other hand, it makes for a frustrating show when week after week, nothing happens. This is why I think that Savage as a main villain is the wrong move. I hope that the writers agree with me as this season wraps and season two approaches over the horizon.</p>

<p>The gang is finally reaching their destination of Deephome, but are they truly ready to face the sins of their past. It is widely known that Jaela is extremely not invited to Aludra&#8217;s wedding which is currently the biggest pickle that needs to be overcome. Maybe Jaela and the rest are not ready to face the mistakes of the past. Maybe Aludra truly has moved on. Maybe Jett did in face start the demon apocolyse and created Harper and Jaela&#8217;s secret handshake&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve read the first two books in this series, you already know that there&#8217;s no way you <em>can&#8217;t</em> read the third. It&#8217;s impossible to resist these books, and impossible not to devour them once you have them. I&#8217;m pleased to report that book three is no different.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also no different in its take on the war between White witches and the Black, Half, and otherwise rebellious Alliance. Things are still dire, and tragedy abounds, dogging Nathan and his companions wherever he goes. Nathan knows he&#8217;ll never be free of it until Soul and Wallend, the evil mastermind of the war and his Mengele-like right-hand man, are dead or captured. Standing between them are the Hunters, ruthless and increasingly overpowered fighters who want to wipe out anyone who does not submit to Soul&#8217;s rule.</p>
<p>In the face of these impossible<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-37094" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/51GAPXY2TpL._SY344_BO1204203200_.jpg" alt="51GAPXY2TpL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_" width="230" height="346" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/51GAPXY2TpL._SY344_BO1204203200_.jpg 230w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/51GAPXY2TpL._SY344_BO1204203200_-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" /> odds, Nathan is breaking down. He&#8217;s killed so many people, he&#8217;s watched his father die and been forced to eat his heart, and he&#8217;s lost the girl he thought he loved to either circumstances or subterfuge. Annalise&#8217;s betrayal, whether calculated or not, gnaws at him and makes him even more reckless than before.</p>
<p>The prose is as crisp and urgent as ever, and Green doesn&#8217;t waver in progressing the plot as she always does: with dire need and mayhem. More dear comrades are lost, more moral choices greyed down until good and bad seem like shadows of each other. The only bright point is Gabriel, whose love for Nathan eschews moral absolutes in favor of compassion for Nathan&#8217;s past and hope for his future.</p>
<p>Nathan&#8217;s love for Gabriel, always strong, only grows over the course of the book. They have moments of real breakthrough and insight with one another, and this goes from being a somewhat fantastical story of Gabriel&#8217;s unwavering devotion to a story about really human young men trying to grapple with their demons and one another. It&#8217;s a really beautiful&#8211;if still dark and troubled&#8211;thread running through this tapestry of blood and hate and regret, and it makes the tragedies bearable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>****SERIOUSLY THERE ARE SPOILERS****</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>****GUYS SO MANY SPOILERS AHEAD****</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>****ARE YOU REALLY SURE YOU WANT THE SPOILERS?****</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>****OKAY BUT DON&#8217;T SAY I DIDN&#8217;T WARN YOU****</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>****ONE LAST TIME: SPOILERS****</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think a review of this book would be complete without addressing the ending. It&#8217;s polarizing for sure, so let me lay it out for you:</p>
<p>Nathan and Gabriel consummate their romantic feelings and have a genuine relationship. And then Gabriel dies. Jessica shoots Nathan, but the bullets ricochet off him and kill Gabriel instead. Nathan spends a long time in denial, imagining that Gabriel is alive, and a longer time in mourning. Finally, using his innate gift of shapeshifting, Nathan goes to Gabriel&#8217;s grave and turns himself into a tree. My understanding was that, whether by will or the nature of his chosen form, this transformation was permanent.</p>
<p>Let me start by acknowledging the right that queer fans have to be angry with creators who kill gay characters. This is undeniably a trend, and it&#8217;s unequivocally wrong in its abstract form; which is to say, this should not be a trend. Queer characters should survive at the rate of their cishet counterparts.</p>
<p>Not all cishet characters survive, though. So the bigger issue here I think is sussing out whether this is one of those instances in which it was truly the narrative at work, or whether some less purely artistic impulse drove the decision to have these characters die.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-37096" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/51AoxKboxL._SX324_BO1204203200_-1.jpg" alt="51+AoxKboxL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_" width="326" height="499" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/51AoxKboxL._SX324_BO1204203200_-1.jpg 326w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/51AoxKboxL._SX324_BO1204203200_-1-196x300.jpg 196w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/51AoxKboxL._SX324_BO1204203200_-1-298x456.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px" /></p>
<p>Let me first say that intention of the author is, ultimately, impossible to discern. We can speculate and draw some conclusions, but we&#8217;ll never really know. I will say, though, that as a writer myself, that killing major characters is not easy. It is a rare author who might find it so. I doubt very much that Sally Green made this decision lightly, whatever her reasons. And the <em>way</em> that Gabriel dies is resonant with both feeling and narrative weight. Only because of Nathan&#8217;s invulnerability did Gabriel succumb. There&#8217;s a lot to unpack there about the nature of masculine strength, about what power is when you can&#8217;t protect the people you love, and about the selfish/selfless decision Nathan made to become invulnerable in the first place. It&#8217;s not a simple or meaningless death, we can say that much.</p>
<p>So yes, let&#8217;s first acknowledge that some of these decision may be made from a place of believing that queer characters can&#8217;t or shouldn&#8217;t be as happy as straight characters. Other instances stem not from homophobia but the misguided notion that tragedy is deep and happiness is shallow. This is a juvenile impulse, and the refuge of certain weaker talents who can shock with skill, but don&#8217;t know how to show the mundane drama of love, contentment, and commitment. Put together with the fact that many writers are unable or unwilling to write realistic queer relationships, and you have them jumping to murder as a source of tension. (Lesbians are particularly susceptible to this since many writers also don&#8217;t know what to do with female characters, other than kill or threaten them. But that&#8217;s another discussion.)</p>
<p>In this particular instance, the <em>Half</em> trilogy is steeped in tragedy. The books practically <em>bleed</em> Nathan&#8217;s blood and tears. To have a tragic ending is not just fitting, it&#8217;s nearly inevitable. Do I <em>like</em> it? No. But that&#8217;s because Green has made me care so strongly for her beautiful characters. My caring doesn&#8217;t protect them from the world she&#8217;s created, though. Their lives aren&#8217;t fair. It isn&#8217;t fair that Gabriel dies because of his devotion, while Annalise, who shrank from hard decisions, lived and flourished at the end. I don&#8217;t like it at all.</p>
<p>But ultimately, I think artists have the right to create the vision of their art that&#8217;s right for them. This series is set in a brutal, unhappy, unfair world, and Green does not imagine that Nathan&#8217;s suffering and sacrifice earn him respite. Given that throughout the books she has always given thoughtful consideration to the nature and psychology of suffering, I do not think her stance is unjustified. She has clearly worked hard and pondered long, and I cannot lump her in with those juvenile writers who think suffering is deep. She knows it&#8217;s not. She knows violence isn&#8217;t like in an action movie; she knows it&#8217;s brutal and soul-eating. All Nathan wants is to live a quiet life by a river with his love. But she also knows the world isn&#8217;t fair.</p>
<p>So yes, this book stands as an exception for me in some ways. I understand those who disagree with me. After all, this book, however good, however thoughtful, still does fit into that larger trend of queer protagonists never seeming to get happy endings. So my solution is not to try to convince you any more than I have. The answer, I think, is&#8211;as it always is&#8211;more art. More stories from authors who write happy endings. More queer stories generally. The rainbow symbol of LGBTQ rights should not just stand for a spectrum of genders and sexualities, but for the range of human experiences that LGBTQ people&#8211;like everyone else&#8211;live with and through every day.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>PS &#8211; if you want a gay couple in a fantasy book with a happy ending, read Rainbow Rowell&#8217;s <em>Carry On</em>. It&#8217;s just as many feels, but giddy instead of wrenching.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Book geeks and Geeklies who love books often want to branch out, so I&#8217;ll be doing a few lists of works in translation, starting with Japanese novels. Japanese fiction is fairly well established in English translation, so I&#8217;m going to avoid such obvious talents as the Murakamis—Haruki and Ryu—who have achieved international fame, or Kawabata and Oe, who each won the Nobel Prize in Literature. And of course Mishima, whose spectacular (literally—it was a spectacle) death overshadows his spectacular writing. No, these are lesser-known writers who deserve some love, and whose stories at least touch upon the SFF realm.</p>

The grandmother is psychic, the mother is gang leader turned manga artist, and the daughter is trying to unravel a murder. Add to it the whole history of 20th century Japan, a cast of extremely colorful townsfolk, and you&#8217;ve got one hell of a crazy-cool book.</p>

Spirits and gods abound in her fictional realm, and many lands need saving. You can feel her research flowing through the narrative, but it only enhances the story of Balsa, the spearwoman trying to atone for eight deaths by saving eight lives.</p>

Piercings, tattoos, and the peculiar process of gradually splitting one&#8217;s tongue all adorn this tale of unabashed lusts. It&#8217;s incredibly short but packs a punch.</p>

Well, it is, and it came first. It&#8217;s still different enough from the manga, the anime, the movie, and the American remake to be worth plunging into the same story&#8211;or what you thought was the same story. A bit dated now that we have the internet and the concept of &#8220;viral&#8221; has changed, but still a great mystery, with meditations on the price rage and cruelty to back up its horror instead of jump scares.</p>

Not a strangely compelling enough summary for you? All right: Kayu, like all villagers who turn 70, is brought up the mountain to die rather than be a burden on her family. She expects to die, but is rescued by a commune of women who want to destroy the village that sentenced them to death. But first, they&#8217;ll have to survive the winter with a hungry bear.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blindspot &#8211; Older Cutthroat Canyon<img class="size-medium wp-image-36952 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/f5496ce6d4775b18f72d7d6bc5e7-300x200.jpg" alt="f5496ce6d4775b18f72d7d6bc5e7" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/f5496ce6d4775b18f72d7d6bc5e7-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/f5496ce6d4775b18f72d7d6bc5e7-768x513.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/f5496ce6d4775b18f72d7d6bc5e7-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/f5496ce6d4775b18f72d7d6bc5e7-620x414.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/f5496ce6d4775b18f72d7d6bc5e7.jpg 809w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
This was a big, exciting, action-packed episode. Unfortunately, all the events felt forced. This seemed to be the point in the plot when the writers said &#8220;ok, we&#8217;ve had a few boring episodes, let&#8217;s throw all the action into this episode&#8221;. It&#8217;s not necessarily a bad move, but it does reflect an uneven pacing in the overall plot. With all the action, this episode also relied heavily on the coincidental tropes of the genre. That, in turn, ratchet up the forced dramatic moments. This was not a bad episode. The action was great. It was just very cliche. Through all the action, a few new details were revealed about the larger mystery, but it was all handled in a chaotic, confusing way. Maybe I&#8217;ve forgotten a few details over the course of the season, but did the show just randomly introduce the guy that answered Jane&#8217;s call on the pay phone? It seems like she&#8217;s interacted with him before and that he&#8217;s important to the plan. But I cannot remember him existing before this moment. Personally, I&#8217;m at a point where the novelty of the show is fading and the weekly procedural tropes are failing to successfully hold my attention. The new twists and turns of the plot and all the secondary story lines of who is betraying who are intriguing, but not enough. I want answers. I need a payoff. Obviously, the final reveal will be withheld until the season finale. But with the show being renewed, what kind of answers can really be expected? Something has to carry over to keep the show going. Clearly, the show is sitting on a its biggest secret. <em>Blindspot</em> is not a bad show, but it is extremely stingy in its plot development. The strategy has a degree of success. I eagerly await every episode to see what comes next. But I also feel like there&#8217;s a lot of unnecessary filler material in the plot.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-36953 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/gotham-prisoners-300x200.jpg" alt="gotham-prisoners" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/gotham-prisoners-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/gotham-prisoners-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/gotham-prisoners-1200x800.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/gotham-prisoners-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/gotham-prisoners-620x413.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Gotham &#8211; Prisoners</span></strong><br />
Oh look, Gordon&#8217;s already out of jail. Wow. Who would&#8217;ve thought that would happen? <em>Gotham&#8217;s</em> lack of consequences aside, this was almost a good episode. The plot was focused and clear. The opening montage set a tone of sorrow and desperation that the rest of the episode actually supported. And while it was a minor detail, I liked the effects that were used for Penguin&#8217;s nightmare. But the majority of the episode was typical <em>Gotham</em> garbage. The warden was yet another scene-chewing over the top caricature. The plotting of the Van Dahls was a lesson in pure mustache-twirling villainy. The seduction scene had a degree of humor, but it was still badly done. And the rape jokes were in extremely bad taste. Who approved them? Whoever wrote for this family should be fired. Kids that stare blankly and parrot lines then flip a switch and become scheming villains? Horrible. Swapping pills for mints right outside the room? Poison that sizzles and steams with terrible CG? The entire plot line was badly conceived and developed. As was everything that happened while Gordon was in jail. The random officer that helped him didn&#8217;t get any explanation as to why, but the warden and random inmate got at least one line of exposition. Puck was a criminal waste of screen time. He existed only to be beaten to death. It could be argued that he was there to encourage Gordon to be a hero, but the entire series has demonstrated Gordon&#8217;s determination to do so even though he always picks the wrong way to try. Gordon&#8217;s escape was one of the most badly written scenes in all of <em>Gotham</em>. How did a blood bag get slipped under his shirt without his knowledge? Why would the warden or prison doctors not check the body? Why is head butting the attack of choice in this jail? And please don&#8217;t forget that Gordon&#8217;s task is now not only to clear his name of the one and only murder that he did not commit, but to overcome the fact that he escaped from jail. Simply proving that he was framed doesn&#8217;t mean that he&#8217;ll erase the second crime of assaulting an officer and escaping jail. But logic means nothing within the walls of Gotham. Look at Flacone. After being abandoned multiple times during these past two seasons, he&#8217;s brought in randomly to save the day. It&#8217;s almost like people don&#8217;t exist in <em>Gotham</em> until they are needed in the main story. The ending scene was very frustrating. Gordon was pounded with fortune cookie wisdom until he stared off at a terrible CG skyline of Gotham City. <em>Gotham</em> doesn&#8217;t have good characters or plot, so it relies on forced drama. It is such a shame that this show keeps getting renewed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Supernatural &#8211; Red Meat<img class="size-medium wp-image-36954 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/Supernatural_-_Episode_11.17_-_Red_Meat-300x185.jpg" alt="Supernatural_-_Episode_11.17_-_Red_Meat" width="300" height="185" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/Supernatural_-_Episode_11.17_-_Red_Meat-300x185.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/Supernatural_-_Episode_11.17_-_Red_Meat-298x183.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/Supernatural_-_Episode_11.17_-_Red_Meat.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
The opening montage of Dean&#8217;s greatest deaths was entertaining. As was starting the episode in the middle of the action and then flashing back to how events got the boys there. I always enjoy that story telling method. The back and forth plot, both in time and between story lines, is a successful way to keep the show entertaining. And I really enjoyed the fact that this wasn&#8217;t the typical monster of the week episode. Seeing the Winchesters pushed to the edge of failure and barely surviving was actually the best part, in my opinion. It&#8217;s good to know that these boys aren&#8217;t always the heroes riding in to save the day. Yes, it&#8217;s always been a point of the show that hunters are just average people who know a few things, but the show tends to focus on successes instead of failures. The boys were ultimately successful, but it was not an easy win. All of that being said, this was a typical filler episode. The token mention of the Darkness was made, but there was no development of the main plot. It wasn&#8217;t a bad episode at all. It was entertaining and dramatic without being too over the top. It was just a regular episode. I do have to call out the writers on two things, though. When new werewolf hipster tried to kill Dean, he stupidly attempted to strangle him. Not five minutes earlier, he had punched a cop&#8217;s heart out. It could be argued that he was still understanding his new abilities, but this was clearly written to give Sam time to save the day. It could&#8217;ve been done much less obviously. Also, did Sam in his near-death state kill those other two werewolves? Or is they just hanging out in the woods, waiting to munch on the next batch of campers that comes through? But these minor problems are typical for <em>Supernatural</em>, so I don&#8217;t really care that much. I would&#8217;ve liked to see more of Billie. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed the Reapers. Plus, they link back to a pretty big unanswered question from the end of last season. I&#8217;m hoping for a good development in that area, and not just some quick exposition. Maybe if the show can get back to resolving the main plot of this season, some additional answers can be found.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-36955 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/Lucifer-Pops-300x172.png" alt="Lucifer-Pops" width="300" height="172" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/Lucifer-Pops-300x172.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/Lucifer-Pops-298x170.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/Lucifer-Pops.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Lucifer &#8211; Pops</strong></span><br />
Another boring case of the week episode. But it wasn&#8217;t a bad episode. <em>Lucifer</em> has a very strict, if cliche and boring, formula and this show did exactly what it was supposed to do. That being said, I didn&#8217;t care about what happened. Nothing in this episode was interesting or appealing in any way. The secondary story of cops being tasked with killing Lucifer is not exciting. The demons getting in touch with their humanity is dull forced drama. The biggest problem with <em>Lucifer</em> is that there isn&#8217;t a strong foundation plot on which to build the procedural shenanigans. Things are just happening with nothing to tie them together. I really don&#8217;t know this problem exists. The source material is fantastic. And the show actually established some good concepts in the pilot episode. But then nothing happened. <em>Lucifer</em> is not a bad show, it&#8217;s just no different than any other procedural drama.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>iZombie &#8211; Pour Some Sugar, Zombie<img class="size-medium wp-image-36959 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/960-300x169.jpg" alt="960" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/960-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/960-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/960-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/960-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/960.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
This episode was pretty awesome. Beyond appealing to certain base instincts, this episode packed in the comedy and snark. The title cards were on point (that&#8217;s a thing kids say these days, right?). I loved that scene with the gang discussing <em>Friends</em> and Major quipping about the phone call. This type of dialogue has been missing from the show for awhile and it&#8217;s wonderful to see its return. The brain BLT montage was great, but not as great as Ravi&#8217;s cheesy stripper dance. Having Payton be in the know on the zombie vision thing brings an interesting dynamic to the show. I wonder if the show will involve more of this type of crime solving in the future. Kudos to the writers for sneaking in so many sharp, funny jokes. Helvatica. Enough said. Babineaux got some great moments in this episode. He&#8217;s a perfect straight man to the craziness of the show. The core plot didn&#8217;t move forward a lot, but a lot of satisfying developments happened. The Ravi/Major scene at the end was surprising and intense. I honestly did not expect that to happen. Add in Blaine&#8217;s amnesia and Liv learning about Drake and this got a lot more interesting. I enjoyed every second of this episode. <em>iZombie</em> suffered a few boring filler episodes, but redeemed itself right here. I need more of this quality writing and delivery next time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-36960 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/fla217b_0178b-300x217.jpg" alt="fla217b_0178b" width="300" height="217" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/fla217b_0178b-300x217.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/fla217b_0178b-768x555.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/fla217b_0178b-298x215.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/fla217b_0178b-620x448.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/fla217b_0178b.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The Flash &#8211; Flash Back</strong></span><br />
I&#8217;m a bit surprised that it took so long for time travel to be the solution to Team Flash&#8217;s problems. I&#8217;m also confused as to why Barry can run fast enough to go back in time, but still isn&#8217;t considered fast enough to catch Zoom. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about the time wraith. It made for an interesting creature to fight. And it eliminated what would&#8217;ve been a boring &#8220;Barry pretending to be Barry&#8221; plot. But it almost feels too cliche. However, this was a very enjoyable episode. I liked the dynamic that is developing with Wally. Everything is still pointing towards him becoming a speedster one day. Even thought this was just a filler episode, I didn&#8217;t care. The story was very entertaining and it kept me engaged. It also really felt like a comic book. I am always impressed with the writing team for <em>Flash</em>. The subject matter of most episodes is silly and tropey, but it&#8217;s always handled in a way that makes sense. And this episode very successfully made me more excited for what comes next.</p>
<div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Arrow &#8211; Beacon of Hope<img class="size-medium wp-image-36961 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/AR417b_0291b_FULL-715x400-300x168.jpg" alt="AR417b_0291b_FULL-715x400" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/AR417b_0291b_FULL-715x400-300x168.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/AR417b_0291b_FULL-715x400-298x167.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/AR417b_0291b_FULL-715x400-620x347.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/AR417b_0291b_FULL-715x400.jpg 715w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
I&#8217;m glad this episode started with a reminder about bee girl. Because I had completely forgotten about her. The opening combat was pretty good. It was fun to watch and it let the team get in some much-needed quippy conversation. Merlyn and Dahrk had some great moments. And bringing Curtis onto the team makes a lot of sense, if that is what&#8217;s going to happen. But the majority of this episode was on the silly side, especially when the robot bees Voltroned their way into a dude for the team to punch. I know that Arrow was trying to take on a lighter tone this season, but it hasn&#8217;t happened consistently. Thus, this episode, which dove deeply into the spandex super hero pool, felt strange. The show was not bad in any way. But it doesn&#8217;t seem to fit with the show&#8217;s tone. However, that twist at the end certainly pulled the show back to the typical <em>Arrow</em> vibe. I definitely miss having Felicity on the team, but I do like her decision to improve focus on the company and use it to improve the world. This should introduce the debate of which course of action is actually heroic: being a vigilante or doing altruistic deeds. It&#8217;s late in the game, but this could make <em>Arrow</em> even more  interesting.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-36962 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/two-swords-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-s1e9-300x183.jpg" alt="two-swords-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-s1e9" width="300" height="183" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/two-swords-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-s1e9-300x183.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/two-swords-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-s1e9-298x181.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/two-swords-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-s1e9.jpg 460w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Legends of Tomorrow &#8211; Left Behind</strong></span><br />
I was so excited for <em>Legend&#8217;s</em> return that I almost missed Snart&#8217;s joke during that opening. Loved it. I also did not expect anything that happened in this episode. Unfortunately, the biggest surprise was spoiled due to live tweets of the episode, but I still enjoyed the reveal. But I actually enjoyed the bits with Nanda Parbat and Ra&#8217;s more. Sara as part of the League is just amazing. And I love this version of Ra&#8217;s. His time on Arrow was fantastic and it&#8217;s great to see him back in action. Plus, almost too subtle drop about his daughter? Perfect. What I did not like is Kendra and how her quick chat undid Sara&#8217;s awesomeness. As much as I like the Hawk characters, Kendra hasn&#8217;t been given a chance to develop. She&#8217;s just there doing things and being important. I want some justification for her existence. I wish that Snart hadn&#8217;t received the magic science fix. They could&#8217;ve done something cool with that. The biggest part of this episode, however, was Ray and Kendra&#8217;s time stuck in the 1950s. I really enjoyed the fact that Ray was the one to want to retain that life. It adds a nice level of development to a character that was otherwise fairly one-dimensional. With the team heading to the future (even though it once again points out how bad Rip is at time travel) I hope that the next episodes will build some momentum towards a resolution. While Savage is one of my favorite DC villains, I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s developed enough in <em>Legends</em> to be a multi-season enemy. I think he will serve best to open the doors for more challenges as the show enters season two.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I, like most people, am a very big fan of RPGs. I feel like I have rulebooks for various systems sitting around my home. When I purchased these books, there were good intentions such as actually playing them. Sadly, with my gaming group, I have a hard time convincing them to try new systems or getting them to commit to a date. So it wasn&#8217;t long before I was asking around through various forms of communication about being able to play through forums. Almost instantly I was informed about the world of play by post.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you&#8217;re at all confused about what that is let me tell you. Play by post (PbP) is a type of game where you are able to play various tabletop RPGs through a forum. People can volunteer to run games or apply for a spot in ones that are already being set up. It does tend to be a little slower since you have wait for other players and the GM to respond, but overall it&#8217;s an enjoyable experience. My favorite thing about Play by Post is not having to schedule a time to play, I can just go to my computer or phone and see if anything is new.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There are quite a few sites that can be used for this, but the one I was introduced to was <a href="http://www.gamersplane.com" target="_blank">Gamer&#8217;s Plane</a>. It&#8217;s a great community with a site developer who is very active in everything involving the site, from bugs in character sheets to promoting new games that are being created on Twitter. Gamer&#8217;s Plane has all kinds of systems available to play from your popular games like <em>D&amp;D</em> or <em>Pathfinder</em> to some less known systems like 1<em>3th Age</em> or <em>Must Eat Brains</em>. This is the site where I had my first experience with a play by post game, I even got to play with some fellow Geeklies. It didn&#8217;t take me long to find that I wanted to run my own game.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I knew instantly I wanted to run <em>Chaosium&#8217;s Horror on the Orient Express</em> for the 7<em>th edition of Call of Cthulhu</em>. I&#8217;ve had that campaign for about a year and, because of the above mentioned scheduling failures, was unable to get my group to commit. This was not the case when I set the game up. What felt like almost instantly, I was getting messages from players wanting to join the game. I was floored. People wanted to play my game! I wasn&#8217;t greeted with the usual under-enthusiastic reactions of my group. Needless to say, it didn&#8217;t take long for my game to fill up.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Getting the game started was a bit slow to begin with, I must admit. The d100 version of <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> wasn&#8217;t yet on the site and I wanted to wait for it to be added. We also had to go through the whole character creation process which I  is one of my least favorite things to do for C<em>all of Cthulhu.</em> Way too much math for my liking. After a couple of days, the system was added to the site and we had all our characters sorted out. Since then our game has begun and it&#8217;s been smooth sailing since. I&#8217;m incredibly happy with the players enthusiasm to play.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Since I&#8217;ve learned about Gamer&#8217;s Plane and interacted with the community, I decided to look into running more games, like <em>Savage Worlds</em>, <em>Pathfinder</em>, or even <em>D&amp;D 5e.</em> Who knows, I have too many game books to count. All I know is that the eagerness of the players makes me incredibly happy and wanting to do more and help the site grow.It&#8217;s safe to say that my play by post experience has been a very pleasant one. I can honestly say that couldn&#8217;t be made possible without the wonderful folks at Gamer&#8217;s Plane. If you&#8217;re egar to play games but can&#8217;t find anyone locally or can&#8217;t make the time commitment this type of game play should be right up your alley.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All right, Sailor Moon Crystal, here we go again. Time for the Infinity Arc, the third season that will introduce the Outer Senshi and bring us the Witches 5. But first…the opening credits!</p>

<p>You know, I like this song. Do I think it fits with the season? No. The music box tinkling intro, the gentleness—it really should have gone with the first season(s), and “Moon Pride” could have gone with this one. But still, not bad. My only significant observation is <em>w</em><em>ow</em> the intro is channeling <em>Madoka Magica</em> something fierce. It’s not just the lacy, flowery embellishments that move in the strange, collage-like way that Madoka pioneered. No, it’s the depiction of Chibi-Usa and Hotaru. Does anyone else see the Madoka/Homura parallel there? Especially with the hair. I admit it never occurred to me to see Hotaru and Chibi-Usa as a shippable pair since they’re so young, but I guess it makes sense.</p>

<p>Mamoru and Rei are having terrible premonitions of disaster, and Usagi is dreaming about…her wedding. Ah, good. All is well in the Sailor Moon universe when Usagi is focused on love and a bright future. And I mean that sincerely. Crystal lost a lot of points with me by making everything so dour, so this amusing contrast has me hopeful for some impending humor. Still, they could have played it up more for laughs.</p>

<p>While Usagi sleeps in, Tokyo has its first rumblings of supernatural threats (again). The newscaster describes a monster attack as a “bizarre incident.” I forget, is this version of Tokyo one where everyone rides mini-Godzillas to work and has cyborg mecha-ninja girlfriends and demon pop-idol boyfriends? Is this, in other words, an anime in which the characters are a bit more aware they live in anime-land?</p>
<p>Oh, no. No, there’s the barest, <em>barest</em> attempt at a “scientific” explanation. They’re calling it “reversion,” with humans spontaneously turning back into ape-like creatures. Crystal, you managed almost ten minutes, but now I hate you and wish you were a person so I could flick your face. <em>Reversion?</em> Seriously?</p>
<p>Everyone is totally blasé about this and moves on. Papa Tsukino doesn’t even get off the couch, and Mama Tsukino is more worried about Usagi’s lunch than the fact that there might be a giant, red-eyed monster ravaging the city where her girls just ran off to school. You know, I take it back. This definitely has to be anime-land.</p>

<p>Mamoru, likewise completely chill, awaits Usagi at that park with the ugly clock, and we get a brief romantic moment before Chibi-Usa joins them. There’s still that weird jealousy between Usagi and Chibi-Usa as they compete for Mamo’s attention, which I still hate and still wish would go away. (They’re doing better on the animation, though, using the tropes of anime to actually <em>be</em> an anime, complete with sweat-drops and sparkles and pulsing anger veins. Woo!) And, well, Chibi-Usa does rush off after a brief dose of it, so at least it’s not sustained. She goes to join her friends, one of whom is wearing a qipao, because you can’t be Chinese in Japan without constantly identifying yourself as such, I guess.</p>
<p>Exit Chibi-Usa and enter the Outers. We’re treated to a couple of lingering closeups of Michiru’s swimsuit-clad body, and it’s just so disgustingly male gaze I can’t. I can’t! What’s the point of that sequence, other than to objectify her? Sure, she’s a swimmer, but always before those shots were meant to reveal flirtations between her and Haruka, not between her and the audience. Plus, where’s the mention that she’s a world-class violinist and artist? Crystal, I am disappoint.</p>
<div id="attachment_36985" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-36985" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.18.26-AM-1200x750.png" alt="Even Usagi wonders why a full minute of objectification is necessary." width="620" height="388" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.18.26-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.18.26-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.18.26-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.18.26-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.18.26-AM-620x388.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.18.26-AM.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Even Usagi wonders why a full minute of objectification is necessary.</p></div>
<p>Haruka (whose name my autocorrect keeps trying to tell me is <em>Hark</em>), meanwhile, is a driver that all of Japan can be proud of. She’s entirely covered up. She’s also not yet revealed to be a <em>she</em>: they’re still using male pronouns. Which, fine, the original did that too. I’ll be interested to see how they handle the reveal.</p>
<p>But hey, at least they introduced the choppers. Yes, in the original, a climactic sequence has Michiru and Haruka inexplicably in a helicopter. Now it’s clear that they own those choppers and use them to get to school. (I get that Tokyo’s crowded, but <em>really? </em>That is just excruciatingly dumb. Not Crystal’s fault, since it’s from the manga, but dumb.) Their school is Mugen Academy, which the writers were likewise clever to put right at the forefront, since that also seemed obnoxiously convenient in the original. And all right, they mention Michiru’s violin skills here—better late than never.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-36983" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.17.04-AM-1200x750.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-05 at 10.17.04 AM" width="620" height="388" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.17.04-AM-1200x750.png 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.17.04-AM-300x188.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.17.04-AM-768x480.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.17.04-AM-298x186.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.17.04-AM-620x388.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-10.17.04-AM.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Switching back to Usagi, we’re reintroduced to the Inner Senshi at the arcade, and Usagi and Haruka have a race. Haruka sorta-not-really flirts with Usagi, and Michiru kinda-doesn’t-really flirt with Mamoru outside. Oh, and Michiru says that her mirror reflects people’s past lives, which is <em>such a cool idea</em> but I doubt if it will really get any more mention than that.</p>
<p>Aaaaaaand scene. That’s it. No more outer Senshi. The rest of the episode finally shows us one of those…sigh…<em>Reversions</em> when a girl is randomly transformed into a towering monster. Yes, I can totally see how this deformed spider-tick that emerges from smoke and glows would make people think it was a devolved human. Of course! <em>It’s so obvious.</em></p>

<p>The Senshi gear up for battle, and while the transformation sequences still annoy me because their limbs seem so bendy and distorted, it’s a HUGE improvement over the CGI. And, apparently, a huge improvement in power over last season, too, since Venus and Jupiter make short work of the monster. (Rei and Ami help a little, too.) I don’t mind that they’re able to be badasses. In fact, it’s kind of nice to see the girls work together and get shit done. I do fear, though, that Crystal still hasn’t learned to make Usagi’s hope and kindness the heart of the show. Without her, it’s just girls beating up monsters, which is 33% of all anime at this point.</p>

<p>The girls all get catchphrases, too. Some of them had one before, but Jupiter’s is ner: “I’ll make you feel so much regret, it’ll leave you numb.” It doesn’t really measure up to “douse yourself in water and repent,” but I guess it gets the job done. But Minako’s “allow me to punish you with love” is just a dominatrix getting consent. Yikes. At least they made Minako’s attack much, much better. Wink Chain Sword is super cool visually, works with her “kawaii defender” theme, and is extremely effective. Jupiter’s Coconut Cyclone, meanwhile, is…well at least it looks cool.</p>

<p>The Senshi draw a crowd by the time they’re done with the monster, but this is anime-world, so there are absolutely no consequences, and no one tries to take them in for questioning or get their autographs or anything. The girls just get to stand around looking quizzical, and then hie on back to their base, where they make the astute deduction to look into Mugen Academy. Good job, girls! And good job composers, since the credits theme is also decent.</p>
<p>Conclusion: cautiously optimistic! Until next time,</p>

<p>Our main man Jett Razor is up to his neck in debt so things get dicey. Let&#8217;s just say we are in a bar and &#8230; a certain amount of brawling ensues. Which is nice. Our old bones have been craving a bar based tussle for many years. Feels great getting back into the swing of this whole &#8220;adventurer&#8221; thing, besides all the people dying and all. We still miss Bearcharger and Tad. Dang now I am sad.</p>
<p>Join us in June in Portland for <a href="http://www.geeklycon.com">GeeklyCon 2016</a>!!!</p>
<p>The adventure continues with Titus Harper (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/timlanning">Tim Lanning</a>), Jett Razor (<a href="https://twitter.com/themikebachmann">Mike Bachmann</a>), Nyx/ Aludra (<a href="https://twitter.com/jennifercheek">Jennifer Cheek</a>), Jaela (<a href="https://twitter.com/Nika_Howard">Nika Howard</a>) and your Dungeon Master (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/thriftynerd">Michael DiMauro</a>).

<p>This week we catch up with Cersie in her gaol for the first time in A Dance with Dragons. This confused us for about 5 minutes, but I have cut that out&#8230; It gets a bit confusing when you read the books in chronological order. We also have a new perspective, old Barry Barristan is roaming around without Dany. Vicatrion is out to see and he&#8217;s a big ole dummy. Tyrion starts to get his mojo back and Jon Snow has lots of ominous foreshadowing that I&#8217;m sure will amount to nothing!</p>

The Queensguard (Barristan I): ADWD 56<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQApHrKN-OX4LLhp&amp;w=470&amp;h=246&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blacktablegames.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F06%2FInglorious_Space_Logo_forDa.png&amp;cfs=1&amp;upscale=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m piloting my tiny spaceship through the darkest reaches of space when the aliens appear.  They&#8217;re pixelated and their movement is slow and mindless, but inexorable.  If I don&#8217;t snag all the upgrades I can, my ship will be underpowered and I won&#8217;t be able to escape with my life.  I defeat a boss, but there&#8217;s no rest and they keep coming.  It takes all of my skills as a pilot to avoid being destroyed while dealing damage to the aliens trying to blast me to space dust.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, I recognize that while my situation brings to mind an old-school shoot-&#8217;em-up like Gradius, I&#8217;m playing this scenario out on a tabletop game in my kitchen.  The game is <em>Inglorious Space,</em> and it attempts to bring the “tiny spaceship vs. hordes of enemies” motif of old-school shoot-em-ups to board gaming.</p>
<p><em>Inglorious Space </em>comes from <a href="http://www.blacktablegames.com/">Black Table Games</a>, an independent design company run by Jesse Gregory, known to Geekly readers and listeners as the creative mind behind the music of SAYER.  Gregory, and Black Table are currently running a Kickstarter campaign to support the production of <em><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blacktablegames/inglorious-space">Inglorious Space</a>, </em>that ends in just over 16 days. I had the opportunity this past week to play a preview copy of  <em>Inglorious Space, and here&#8217;s how things went. </em></p>
<p><strong><u><img class="aligncenter wp-image-36785" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2937.jpg" alt="IMG_2937" width="597" height="447" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2937.jpg 1440w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2937-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2937-768x576.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2937-1200x900.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2937-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2937-620x465.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" />First Impressions:</u></strong></p>
<p>I loved the artwork immediately.  As an old man, the pixelated graphics brought me back to a time when there was no saving your game, when game slowdown could either be a help or a hindrance depending on what you were playing, and when I wore my socks pulled up to my knees.  Bottom line-the art is great, and that greatness continues throughout the rest of the components.  More on that later, but suffice to say my sense of nostalgia was firing on all cylinders.</p>
<p><strong><u>How It Works:</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Inglorious Space</em> can be played by 1-4 players and games can last anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour depending on how your luck plays out.  I played the first time around with my 7 year old son, who was thoroughly impatient with his father as I attempted to read through the manual.  As with most games, it was a struggle to acquaint myself with the jargon and things felt a bit complicated during my first read-through, but,  after playing a few rounds things clear up. By the second game I had the process down pat.</p>
<div id="attachment_36788" style="width: 469px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-36788" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2941.jpg" alt="Check out the Space Mat all set up!" width="459" height="344" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2941.jpg 1440w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2941-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2941-768x576.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2941-1200x900.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2941-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2941-620x465.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Check out the Space Mat all set up!</p></div>
<p>The game is played on the Space Mat, and the goal is to earn the most Victory Points by either killing bad guys or (if you’ve died) creating havoc for the other players by laying traps around the board.  Bad guys spawn at the top and creep slowly downward each turn they’re left alive, attacking in a specific grid pattern.  If your ship ends up on an attacked grid space, you take damage.</p>
<p>Each alien is crafted in the same pixel style that made me love the box from the start, and it was a lot of fun to see what would turn up next.  Enemy cards show HP, Victory Points earned by defeating it, attack map and whether or not you’ll spawn a sweet upgrade by killing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll choose from 1 of 4 distinct pilots to play as, each has his or her own backstory and special abilities, ranging from deflector shields to jump drives to special attacks.  The game is played in Rounds, with each player taking turns performing 1 action at a time.  Actions can include moving, attacking, charging a special ability and ramming bad (or good!) guys with your ship, and all actions are performed by discarding Command Cards in different amounts and combinations.</p>
<p>Kill some aliens, get some Victory Points.  If you have the most VPs after the final wave is over, you win!</p>
<p><strong><u>Digging Deeper:</u></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_36787" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" wp-image-36787" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2940.jpg" alt="Aliens and Upgrades!" width="449" height="337" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2940.jpg 1440w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2940-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2940-768x576.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2940-1200x900.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2940-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2940-620x465.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Aliens and Upgrades!</p></div>
<p>My son told me that he hated the game once we finished, but then amended his answer to say that it was because he died.  In actuality, he loved flying his spaceship around the board killing aliens, stealing upgrades from Daddy, and racking up Victory Points.  He also loved the mechanic that allows a player to keep playing after death.  Once you’ve died in <em>Inglorious Space</em> you lose your points and your ship, but then become a minelayer.  That’s right; you’re now responsible for setting out moving mines in the darkest reaches of space.  Your mines move after everything else has been resolved that round, and if you manage to hit a living player, they take damage and you win Victory Points.  The mechanic works better the more players you’ve got, as a more crowded board makes it</p>
<p>increasingly difficult to avoid the mines, but he had a lot of fun trying to ruin my game.</p>
<p>I played a few more rounds to flesh things out-including a solo game, a round with folks from work and another round with my son and wife.  By his second game, my son was keeping a better eye on the rules than I was, and had figured out the strategy for the game, telling me that <em>Inglorious Space</em> is quick to pick up and simple in its execution.</p>
<p>My solo round was a great exercise in “resource” management, with the resources being the limited amount of moves/actions I received each turn.  I found myself in a very quiet, very concentrated, almost-meditative state trying to maximize the never-enough moves and actions I needed to defeat the alien hordes.</p>
<div id="attachment_36786" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-36786" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2939.jpg" alt="Character and Command Cards" width="574" height="430" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2939.jpg 574w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2939-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2939-298x223.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Character and Command Cards</p></div>
<p><strong><u>Wrapping Up:</u></strong></p>
<p>I enjoyed my playthrough of <em>Inglorious Space</em>, and enjoyed the novel approach of its design.  It triggered a very specific part of me that’s tied to my childhood, and I felt that same rush I got in the 80s after popping in a new NES cartridge for the first time.  I always love a game that pits me against the game mechanic itself, and <em>Inglorious Space</em> did a wonderful job of playing with my emotions-from shaking fists when a rough set of bad guys spawned, to fists-in-the-air excitement when I used my special ability to its maximum potential.</p>
<p><em>Inglorious Space</em> will make a great family game- as my son’s quick success will attest.  He was able to very quickly get the hang of things and have success that wasn’t predicated on daddy or mommy giving him strategy hints.  He lost both times, but it was closer than I’d like to admit.</p>
<p>My advice: check out the Kickstarter links below and toss some money towards <em>Inglorious Space</em>.  Jesse and Black Table Games are asking a very modest amount of backing in order to make this game available to a wider audience.  It’s quick and easy to learn, quick and easy to play, and will develop into a deeply strategic game to play with your friends after a few getting-to-know-the –game sessions.  There is a lot of strategy to explore with <em>Inglorious Space</em>&#8211; and I was only barely able to scratch the surface of the treachery and backstabbing that’s possible within the game.  For example (and I’m both proud and ashamed of this move at the same time): My wife was in position to work in concert with me to take down one of the bigger baddies.  We were trading off on our turns pew-pewing away doing one point of damage at a time, eeny-meeny-miney-moe style.  Doing the math told me she would get the last hit, and thus the Victory Points.  Since I’m a scumbag, I moved on my turn instead of attacking, she attacked as planned, and I swooped in the next turn to grab a sweet 5 VPs.  I foresee much more Inglorious-ness in this game’s future, and am excited to play the selfish dread pirate I’ve always wanted to be.</p>

<p>Did I miss something?  What games do you break out when you&#8217;ve got five?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: #333333;"> </span>Issue 34 was all about plans. We have Noreen’s plan to help Hazel escape prison. Marko and Hazel’s plan break Hazel and Klara out of said prison with the help of Prince Robot IV. The Will’s plan of vengeance on Prince Robot IV for murdering his first love. None of these groups know anything of the other groups’ plans and they are all light-years apart from each other. Issue 35 shows these plans coming to fruition and these groups likely coming back together. Just in time too, there is only one more issue left in this arc! That’s right, one more issue and then another 4 month hiatus!<img class="wp-image-36849 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/343512._SX640_QL80_TTD_1-300x234.jpg" alt="http://www.adventuresinpoortaste.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/343512._SX640_QL80_TTD_1.jpg" width="235" height="183" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/343512._SX640_QL80_TTD_1-300x234.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/343512._SX640_QL80_TTD_1-298x233.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/343512._SX640_QL80_TTD_1-620x484.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/343512._SX640_QL80_TTD_1.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" /></p>
<p>I’m sure issue 36 will be amazing but this issue seems to just be leading up to it. It’s not necessarily a bad thing; it doesn’t feel like filler. I still loved every page, plans are great. These characters need to all be gathered in one place and a lot needs to happen to make that a reality. We get another lovely cover this issue, though Lexis may not be the best tattoo artist. That sword on Klara’s face is totally jacked up! And a facial tattoo? Really Klara, is that setting the best example for Hazel?</p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: #333333;"><img class=" wp-image-36834 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lying-cat-1-300x132.jpg" alt="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2PMCnMFfnxc/Vvyo3WJhSQI/AAAAAAAA0GA/bWTd0NiBhW8CO9NE9dvqNE6BV80u-HNbg/s400/lying%2Bcat.jpg" width="263" height="115" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lying-cat-1-300x132.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lying-cat-1-298x131.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lying-cat-1.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px" /></span></p>
<p>Before we get any further, no Lying Cat this issue. At least not the Lying Cat we know as Lying Cat. This is confusing, Lying Cat is the name of our lovable green friend’s species but it her also her given name. This issue, shows us another member of the Lying Cat species. This one is pink and excessively regal. We know Lying Cat was the runt of her litter, could this fancy feline be her sibling? They look <img class=" wp-image-36835 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/runt-300x228.jpg" alt="http://i1239.photobucket.com/albums/ff516/Henchman4Hire/Saga1802.jpg" width="247" height="188" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/runt-300x228.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/runt-768x585.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/runt-298x227.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/runt-620x472.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/runt.jpg 885w" sizes="(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px" />very similar but I could just be racist. I’m not sure if we will ever get Lying Cat’s backstory or confirmation on whether or not Pinky is her sibling. Still, it was nice to see <em>a</em> Lying Cat again, even if it was not <em>our</em> Lying cat. I have to assume she is not with the Will at all anymore. She must be with Sophie and Gwendolyn but what are they doing? They have been suspiciously absent this arc. Will they be back in issue 36?</p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt;">Oh man, shit is going to go down in issue 36. I can’t wait but I am also extremely nervous! I really have no idea what is going to happen but I have a feeling it is not going to be good. The Image website’s description for Issue 36 just states: Freedom…? What does that mean? I am going to drive myself crazy in anticipation! It doesn’t help that Issue 35 ends on a serious cliffhanger. I know I say this every time but get this issue for the cliffhanger alone. It is…just the best. If you are like me and can’t wait, please pick up issue 35 now. If you are a patient person, issues number 31-36 will be released in trade paperback Volume 6 on June 29<sup>th</sup>, 2016. Who can wait that long though!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>G’day all you beautiful gamers out there! I hope you’re getting your trigger fingers ready for the fast approaching PAXEast, running from April 22 to the 24th. With this auspicious event comes the exciting <a href="”http://indiemegabooth.com/”">Indie Megabooth</a>, a collection of the most innovative, most anticipated games in development by both the known and unknowns of the Independent Videogame Community. For those new to the scene, the Indie Megabooth was created for PAXEast 2012 as a means for the small Studios and Developers to compete with the AAA companies that dominate the convention floor. From their humble beginnings of 17 small studios in attendance to it’s current iteration of 70+, the Indie Megabooth dominates the convention floor and boasts the largest booth at PAX. Not only do they have a slew of quirky and colorful games, they also promote the best in small run boardgames, for those who prefer paper and plastic to 1s and 0s.</p>
<p>Check out their PAXEast 2016 trailer here for a small peek at the kinds of games they’re going to be showcasing:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H-Yo1wbWkJM" width="617" height="420" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>For those hungry for more, I’ve combed through the studios in their roster and have picked out some gems to highlight the types of things you can expect to stand in line to try. For a look at all the games in attendance, check out the full listing on the <a href="http://indiemegabooth.com/event/pax-east-2016/">IMB page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Burly Men at Sea</strong></p>
<p><em>From the IMB Page: Burly Men at Sea is a folktale about a trio of large, bearded fishermen who step away from the ordinary to seek adventure. Set in early 20th-century Scandinavia, the game&#8217;s story branches through discovery in a series of encounters with creatures from folklore. You play as storyteller and wayfinder, shaping the narrative around the characters through interaction with their environment.</em></p>
<p>Immediate impressions: Brain &amp; Brain is a husband-wife indie dev team that has put forth a heavily narrative driven adventure with simplistic, but striking, visuals. It seems to be almost an interactive storybook about three bushy bearded brothers setting forth on their own ocean Odyssey. I’m excited to play the story in this one, proving that complex design isn’t always necessary for a fun game.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/155889871" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Battle Chef Brigade</strong></p>
<p><em>From the IMB Page: &#8220;Fantasy Iron Chef&#8221; Enough said? Nope! Battle Chef Brigade features fantasy chefs, including Orcs, Elves, and Humans, who need to hunt dangerous monsters for ingredients. With those ingredients, before the critical eye of the judges, the chefs create culinary masterpieces in an intense tournament. Battle Chef Brigade pairs one part combo-based action hunting and one part puzzle-based cooking, all as the round clock ticks down.</em></p>
<p>Immediate Impressions: Three game professionals got together and started Trinket Studios. This is their second title release and WHOA it’s a doozie. Immediately the art direction sucks you in with a heavily anime-influenced style reminiscent of the movie, <em>The Girl Who Jumped Through Time</em>. It’s a cross between Iron Chef, and the Wii title Muramasa, where you spend half your time in a kitchen battling for cooking supremacy and the other half out in the wilds battling monsters for their meat and collecting ingredients for your culinary masterpiece, whereupon you create a dish fit enough to be scored by three hard looking judges. Chairman Kaga would be proud.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/StKZvUC5uw8" width="617" height="433" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Kathy Rain</strong></p>
<p><em>From the IMB Page: Developed by Clifftop Games, a one-man studio based in Stockholm, and published by Raw Fury, Kathy Rain tells the compelling story of a strong-willed college girl with a knack for detective work and a Harley who returns to her hometown after being gone since childhood. Set in the 90&#8217;s, Kathy starts investigating a local mystery and the legacy of her recently deceased grandfather.</em></p>
<p><em>As she follows a trail of clues he left behind, questions emerge… What was Joseph Rain really looking for that night all those years ago? What turned him into a mere shell of a man, confined to a wheelchair? What secret did a suicidal young artist take with her to the grave, and why are so many people in Conwell Springs going mad? The truth is dark and sinister&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Immediate Impressions: A soon-to-be released project from <a href="”http://rawfurygames.com”">Raw Fury Games</a>, a small international publishing house that released <em>Kingdom</em> unto the world (and angered spouses because their SOs were busy protecting their citizens from blood-mooned trolls instead of cleaning the dang bathroom). Kathy Rain is a point-and-click RPG with some really slick sound design and beautifully detailed pixel-art. Rather than being combat heavy, it looks to follow a mysterious narrative, and I look forward to losing great swaths of my life to it very soon!</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CI6RKOYZOUY" width="617" height="433" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Below</strong></p>
<p><em>From the IMB Page: Below is a procedural terrarium filled with life, mystery and death.</em></p>
<p><em>Explore. Survive. Discover.</em></p>
<p>Immediate Impressions: This one is from Capybara Games in my hometown of Toronto Ontario, the makers of <em>Super Time Force</em> and the studio with it’s hands deep in the creation of Sword and Sworcery. The preview (because the game is still in production) is light on the actual mechanics, but with really a really great sounding soundtrack (from Jim Guthrie who also worked on Sword and Sworcery) and the studio’s history of putting out some really solid material, I’m willing to put my faith in their next big project. It looks like you descend into the undergrounds of the world to an ever-changing maze of puzzles and combat. I’m in.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Br9tnV9j_0" width="617" height="433" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The Flame in the Flood</strong></p>
<p><em>From the IMB Page: A rogue-lite river journey through the backwaters of a forgotten post-societal America. Travel by foot and by raft down a procedurally-generated river as you scrounge for resources, craft tools, remedy afflictions, evade the vicious wildlife, and most importantly, stay ahead of the coming rains.</em></p>
<p>Immediate Impressions: Avoidance procedures of a racing game? Check. Instant terror feelings with their monster design? Check. Addictive collection mechanics? Check. This is on top of some GORGEOUS design and animation. This new project from a slew of Bioshock alums looks like an apocalyptic survival on a fast moving river with your faithful companion. You have to manage the state of your character with conditions like being Cold, Drenched, Feverous with remedies from the various docking stations along your way, all while avoiding being ripped to shreds by the local wildlife.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7GsRdUWLyMs" width="617" height="433" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Remember, this is only a small selection of what will be available in Boston at the end of the month. As we continue our new series of Indie Game Roundup coverage on GeeklyInc., we’ll dive further into many of the games available through the IMB and the vastness of the internet. We will post highlights and inside scoops from the PAXEast floors as your intrepid Geekly reporters maneuver through the throngs of fans, interview developers and production studios, hold contests for steam keys, and keep you up to the date with best in Indie Games as they are announced!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes children go to fairyland. Sometimes they fight monsters, and save kingdoms, and do a bit of growing on the way. And then sometimes, they come back.</p>
<p>Eleanor West&#8217;s &#8220;school&#8221; is a place where they can go when their families think them deranged or badly in denial. It&#8217;s run by a reject of fairyland, and she does not permit her charges to think themselves insane. But neither does she give them false hope: very few of them will ever make it back to those magical realms. Very few, having found a door, will ever find another.</p>
<p>Into this not-quite-a-home steps Nancy, who has been practicing stillness and silence in the halls of the dead. Her fairyland, like all the children&#8217;s fairylands, is not quite the usual elfin forest we might expect. There are insect realms and nonsense places and cruel gothic castles, and as many other places as would suit a person.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-36748" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/heart-big-800x1200.jpg" alt="heart-big" width="411" height="617" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/heart-big-800x1200.jpg 800w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/heart-big-200x300.jpg 200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/heart-big-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/heart-big-298x447.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/heart-big-620x930.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/heart-big.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px" /></p>
<p>The individuality of these realms is not something I&#8217;d previously encountered, but it makes a comforting sort of sense. In infinite worlds, surely there&#8217;s a place you belong, you specifically. And not only do you belong there, but you&#8217;re cherished as an individual of great skill, since your natural gifts are what align you with the place to begin with. It&#8217;s a nice fantasy. I don&#8217;t mean that snidely: it <em>is</em> a nice fantasy to think that there&#8217;s a place where you can be just as shy or mean or wacky as you want, and that alone will make you succeed.</p>
<p>Succeed, at least, for a time. But it seems a cardinal rule that children must be sent back. They must have a choice on the edge of their adolescence. McGuire was surely thinking of Narnia&#8211;and indeed, she mentions it once or twice in the narrative&#8211;and the wretched non-choice posed to the Pevensie children, to either live as secular sinners or die and enjoy Christian heaven by another name. McGuire&#8217;s choice&#8211;between being most yourself or trying to make it in a world that doesn&#8217;t really accept you&#8211;also seems obvious, but only at first. But you also begin to see where that desire frays into self-indulgence (at best) or outright megalomania (at worst). Sumi may be incisive and delightful, but she&#8217;s also flighty and self-absorbed. Jack and Jill may be darkly romantic, but they&#8217;re also complicit in murder and desecration and don&#8217;t see why they should have empathy for people not useful to them. And all the fringe characters, especially those who went to more typical fairylands with glitter and honor, are unable to see the value in darkness or other thing they find strange. These children do have more growing to do&#8211;but then again, that&#8217;s only according to our rules. Are those rules really better?</p>
<p>McGuire doesn&#8217;t beat you over the head with these ideas, but she does leave plenty of room for reflection once the story comes to an end. I share the perplexity of many reviewers who found this novella rather&#8230;short. Obviously a novella ought to be short. But following a leisurely and elegant intro, the story abruptly shifts gears in a very bloody way. And then, once that plot gets underway, it ends quite abruptly as well. Not unsatisfyingly, mind you. It&#8217;s quite a neat little mystery, and I was pleased to find that I was wrong in my initial suspicions. (It&#8217;s always nice when you can&#8217;t guess the guilty party.) But this novella really seems like it ought to have been a proper novel, with time to get the pacing right and time to let the mystery and tension unfold.</p>
<p>The somewhat Happily Ever After feels a bit unearned after all that came before, tying up the book with a bright red bow. It was disappointing not because I wanted the characters to suffer, but because I wanted the possibility of more. It&#8217;s not a bad criticism to earn when people say your book is too short, that they wish they had more time to get to know the people and places you invented, to relish your turn of phrase. It is a criticism all the same, though. If you do pick this up&#8211;and you ought to, it&#8217;s so <em>lovely</em> on top of being very clever and cool, the writing just right for both beauty and horror&#8211;you do need to be aware that it may not progress as you&#8217;d like. But once you start, you&#8217;ll realize it isn&#8217;t such a hefty price to pay, not when you get a fairyland of your own for a little while.</p>
<p><em>Every Heart a Doorway</em> will be released April 5.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is unquestionably the sparkling, magical queen of the magical girl genre.  What </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> did would redefine the entire genre, as well as introduce an entire generation of young people to manga, anime, and girl power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A brief history of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: in 1991, a one shot manga called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Codename: Sailor V</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was published in the manga magazine RunRun.  Written and drawn by a young woman named Naoko Takeuchi, it became wildly popular.  Toei Animation approached Takeuchi to make an anime from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Codename: Sailor V</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but she instead proposed a show about a team of girl warriors.  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was born out of this, and the anime and manga would be produced almost concurrently over the next 6 years.  Important to note: for simplicity’s sake, I’ll be referring to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a show, though I am not specifically talking about the anime.  I’ll also be referring to characters by their Japanese names for the same reason.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36490" style="width: 566px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36490" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sailormoon_500_0-300x200.jpg" alt="Overly complicating things is unforgivable!

I&#8217;ll punish you!</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been many, many adaptations of the original </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> manga: two animes, three movies, a live action show, multiple musicals, video games and countless other merchandising items.  It would take an entire series of articles for me to break down each adaptation, but I’ll mostly be discussing the original manga, and the original 1992 anime.  I highly encourage any fans of</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who haven’t watched the live action show, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do so.  It had a budget of about 10 dollars, but its heart is in the right place and it does some really interesting things with the source material.  Plus at one point Usagi wears a shirt that says “Burger Lovers” and you don’t get much more </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than that.  Conversely, I don’t particularly recommend </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon Crystal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and if you want to know more about why you should check out <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/?s=sailor+moon+crystal&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">Christina Ladd’s recaps</a> of the show.  At its core, it is a show that does not live up to it’s own theme song.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now if you don’t know, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is about a 14 year old girl named Usagi Tsukino, who meets a black cat named Luna and finds out that she is a pretty guardian of love and justice.  The manga and show follow her and her Sailor Senshi friends throughout about 2 years of their teenage lives, saving the world from a number of various disasters and apocalypses.  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is notable for being one of the first shows to use the Super Sentai format (a team of heroes) for magical girls.  Previous magical girl shows had typically focused on one lead character, and while</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> certainly revolves around Usagi, she is by no means the sole senshi.  I mentioned in my previous article that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gave its female readers the opportunity to have a range of characters to identify with, rather than the token female character.  Shy girls could identify with Ami as opposed to the outgoing Usagi, or vice versa.  That range of characters ended up being crucial to solidifying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a lot of young people’s minds, because they could connect on a level they perhaps could not before.  Even adults now could probably tell you which Sailor Senshi they “were” as a kid.  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;s is completely missing any people of colour, which is a bummer, but is notable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for having a relatively high level of representation for LBGT characters, especially for the early &#8217;90s.  There are two canonical gay couples: Zoicite/Kunzite and Sailor Uranus/Sailor Neptune.  Famously, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus are a gay couple who were turned into “cousins” for the English adaptation.  A fourth season villain named Fish Eye is male, but dresses as a woman when he feels like it and is often considered by fans to be transgender.  And the Sailor Starlights from the fifth season are men, but turn into women when they transform.  While I am a straight, cis woman I admire the show greatly for adding LGBT representation and giving men and women of all temperaments, gender identities, and sexualities a superhero who was like them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides providing a level of representation not seen before in the magical girl genre, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also introduced its audience to something (particularly Western audiences) had not seen before: being a badass warrior who could also be pretty and frilly and feminine.  Sailor Moon is a princess, but she can also vaporize enemies by throwing her tiara at them.  The Senshi wear cute outfits, transform with sparkly pens, but also chuck lightning and fire with their hands.  They are pretty guardians of love and justice, and they will punish you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t overstate how much I unabashedly love </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to this day.  It is goofy yet heartfelt, empowering and humorous, full of magic but grounded in real relationships and situations.  Over the five seasons the characters grow and change, becoming powerful young women to rival their superhero alter egos.  Usagi in particular grows up a lot, starting as a clumsy and lazy crybaby and growing to be a confident and self aware heroine.  Usagi’s growth is not just important because she is the main character, but because at our core we are Usagi.  At fourteen I was not equipped to save the world and neither was she, she even often rejects the role thrust upon her. But over time Usagi learns that she can’t turn away from her destiny, any more than I could turn away from the (admittedly less perilous) changes in my life.  That transformation, not just as a magical girl warrior, but as a person is one of the most important any character or person can go through.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36492" style="width: 519px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36492" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/smtransformation-300x168.jpg" alt="Now if only puberty came with as many sparkles." width="509" height="285" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/smtransformation-300x168.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/smtransformation-298x167.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/smtransformation.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Now if only puberty came with as many sparkles.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that I’ve waxed poetic about my love for the show, I’m going to say a few things about the flip side: what I don’t like about it.  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contains a really interesting dichotomy about female versus male gaze, which can be seen in the manga compared to the original anime.  Series creator Naoko Takeuchi openly said that while the manga was written by women for women, the anime’s staff were almost completely male.  I can’t prove specifically that it’s the cause but there are definitely really interesting instances where the male gaze creeps into the anime.  The role of Mamoru/Tuxedo Mask is quite different for example.  Takeuchi wrote Mamoru as her vision of the ultimate supportive boyfriend, he is Usagi’s greatest cheerleader.  Though their relationship is often a part of the plot, it serves to strengthen it.  Whereas in the anime, Mamoru takes much more of a protector role with Usagi, even to the point of breaking up with her to “protect” her when he believes she’s in danger, rather than talking to her and working together.  Manga Mamoru respects Usagi’s strength and opinion, whereas anime Mamoru often makes decisions for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other big Mamoru based difference between the manga and anime is the ages.  In all versions of the show, Usagi is fourteen years old.  Just let that sink in for a second, fourteen years old, an eighth grader, barely more than is a child.  Now in the manga, Mamoru is seventeen years old, a high school student.  But anime Mamoru is twenty three goddamn years old and in college.  Again, let that sink in.  A twenty three year old man dating a fourteen year old kid.  That’s pretty messed up, and it only appears in the anime.  Now I’m not saying that the men on the anime all want to secretly bone fourteen year old girls, but it’s quite telling that nobody ever seemed to say “Hey guys, this is fucking creepy.” And this is not the only incredibly questionable relationship in the show, though what I’m about to describe is hardly a relationship.  In the first season, Usagi’s best friend Naru falls for an enemy general named Nephrite, who is disguised as a human.  Naru is also fourteen, and while Nephrite’s age is never revealed he is portrayed as an adult man.  And on top of that, he uses Naru’s infatuation with him to emotionally manipulate her into helping him fight Sailor Moon.  In the end, Nephrite supposedly redeems himself before his death by saving Naru from a monster, basically affirming the terrible cliche of “If you love an abuser hard enough, you can fix them.” It is a Grade A fucked up abusive and pedophilic relationship in the middle of a kids show.  And honestly the thing that disappoints me most about it, is that it would have been a great chance to show how abusive relationships work, but that side of the coin never comes.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36493" style="width: 527px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36493" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/naru-and-nephrite-300x225.jpg" alt="Kids, no matter how beautiful his hair is, he's still a pedophile." width="517" height="388" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/naru-and-nephrite-300x225.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/naru-and-nephrite-298x224.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/naru-and-nephrite-620x465.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/naru-and-nephrite.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kids, no matter how beautiful his hair is, he&#8217;s still a pedophile.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last bit of male gaze based weirdness in the show versus manga is the treatment of sexuality.  For the most part it’s not particularly overt in either case.  But again, the manga treats Usagi and Mamoru as much more equal partners in their relationship.  When they do (probably) have sex in the second arc, it’s clearly something they both want out of love.  And Usagi is not passive in her sexuality, there are other instances where she is not afraid to ask Mamoru for sex.  Now in the anime, there’s basically no sex at any point, though there are some references mostly thrown in for comedic value.  Sexuality is addressed in a more abstract, and somewhat creepy way.  For example, the Senshi are almost all portrayed as innocent, virginal figures, despite the fact that for Usagi sex is a part of her relationship in the manga.  But many of the monsters of the week are portrayed as sexed up, buxom, adult women despite the fact that there’s no reason for them to be portrayed that way.  It’s a not so subtle nod towards purity and innocence winning out against overt female sexuality, which is kind of a bummer.  </span></p>
<div id="attachment_36494" style="width: 583px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36494" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Uchoten23-300x200.jpg" alt="I can't even with this one." width="573" height="382" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Uchoten23-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Uchoten23-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Uchoten23-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Uchoten23.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I can&#8217;t even with this one.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now keep in mind, this never stopped the animators from throwing in inexplicable panty shots of our fourteen year old heroines.  The most egregious example has to be in the episode where we find out about Sailor Venus’s past, and she has a moment to herself where she mentally gives up on her past love.  It’s a big character shift for her, and yet for some reason as the camera pans out to show her against a sunset, the wind whips her skirt up to show her underwear.  There’s nothing in the scene that requires her underwear to be showing, and in fact it undercuts the emotional moment of the scene for a bit of fanservice.</span></p>
<p>Okay, so maybe that came off as a little ranty and I applaud you for sticking with me here.  The original anime is almost 25 years old now, so my personal misgivings are not exactly an earth shattering realization to anybody.  The part of me that made me go to art school can’t let a conversation about female versus male gaze pass by.  And all questionable things aside, the amount of good the 92 anime did in terms of representation and empowerment vastly outweigh the nagging weirdness.  Sailor Moon did a lot of good for me in my life, both as a child and now as an adult.  As a girl it taught me that even though you got emotional and didn’t like fighting you could be a superhero.  As an adult it reminds me of the power of friendship, love and badass women.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Living Campaign is a series of articles where every author has an impact on the world. Articles can focus on any part of the setting, from locations to NPCs or even events. Writers can add new elements to the world or they can build upon what already has been defined. This will be a system-agnostic series, meaning that it will provide flavor and content instead of stat blocks and monster entries.</p>
<p>The intent of this series is to provide inspiration for home games. It will draw on foundational elements from Lovecraftian fiction as well as the horror and urban fantasy genres. The ideas presented can be utilized individually, or as a whole. As the setting develops and evolves, special articles will feature story lines within the established world. But all of the content in this series is simply fodder for additional development.</p>
<p>The specific boundaries and details of this campaign setting are intentionally vague. This is done so that all contributors have absolute freedom to create whatever they wish. Authors can add in any geographic details they want, from coastlines to mountains. The city itself might contain a university, manufacturing plants, shipping docks, or any number of physical locations. The general location and time frame will be the United States in the 1920s. However, the nature of this genre lends itself to a certain flexibility. Anything can, and might, happen.</p>
<p>And with the introduction complete…welcome to New Coventry.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anna Ripley &#8211; NPC</span></p>
<p>Anna is a pretty blonde blue-eyed girl from Boston who looks more like her profession of choice should have been an actress or a trophy wife. When asked about this, she replies that she had moved to Hollywood when she was 18 to pursue acting and even took classes. But due to her rather aggressive personality, she was deemed difficult to work with. Thanks to her training, she jumps between her normal Bostonian accent and the transatlantic accent that was the accent of choice for film stars of the time.</p>
<p>Looking for a new start after her failure in Hollywood, she moved to New Coventry. She started working at the newspaper as a receptionist and quickly moved up in the ranks to become a reporter. Even though she is female, she is respected by her co-workers and takes great pride in her work. When she&#8217;s not in the office she can be found around town looking for the latest and greatest scoop, always hoping to find the biggest story that could lead her to stardom, having never completely given up her dreams of being famous.</p>
<p>Since she does have an aggressive personality and tends to be a bit blunt, she runs off the men who prefer women to be seen and not heard. This unfortunately has left her single with very few friends. Seeing as she has to provide for herself her living conditions aren&#8217;t the best. She lives in a small apartment complex that was designed as a home for those less fortunate. Although she doesn&#8217;t enjoy her living conditions she is thankful for what she has and hopes to eventually own a home somewhere.</p>
<p>Anna has big dreams. She may have had a few bumps in the road but with a lot of determination and pride she will make it to the top.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Pretty much everything is back this week. Good times. </em></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blindspot &#8211; Rules in Defiance<img class="size-medium wp-image-36724 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blindspot-300x200.jpg" alt="blindspot" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blindspot-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blindspot-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blindspot-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blindspot-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blindspot.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
This episode starts off with the results of cliche rough sex between tough people, another level of the betrayal conspiracy and lots of shaky cam action. Maybe it was to make up for last week&#8217;s very boring episode. Also returning is the tattoo of the week that just happens to connect to a time-sensitive crime of the week. Unfortunately, it has become core to the show, so it&#8217;s a necessary evil. Luckily, it&#8217;s not as stupid as the tracker in the necklace. Everyone knew that it was going to get ripped off as soon as Zapata got jumped, right? The more important question, though, is what did this case have to do with the larger plot? It seemed like it was just a thing that happened to facilitate the other story elements and get to those two dramatic moments at the end. I understand that this type of thing has to happen in procedural dramas, but it&#8217;s sloppy. So much of the <em>Blindspot</em> story is built upon interconnected plot elements. I don&#8217;t think it would be so difficult to keep the crime of the week related to the other more important events. One of the biggest frustrations of Blindspot is Jane&#8217;s secret friend. While keeping things mysterious is part of the plot, as a viewer, I cannot understand why this guy wouldn&#8217;t just share the information that he has. Hearing him constantly make excuses about why he can&#8217;t just explain what&#8217;s happening is getting stupid. It is certainly the weak point of an otherwise strong show.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-36725 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gotham-sc12-0667-f-hires1-173520-300x180.jpg" alt="gotham-sc12-0667-f-hires1-173520" width="300" height="180" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gotham-sc12-0667-f-hires1-173520-300x180.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gotham-sc12-0667-f-hires1-173520-768x462.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gotham-sc12-0667-f-hires1-173520-298x179.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gotham-sc12-0667-f-hires1-173520-620x373.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gotham-sc12-0667-f-hires1-173520.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Gotham &#8211; Mad Gray Dawn</strong></span><br />
So is the same person writing the titles for both <em>Blindspot</em> and <em>Gotham</em>? This is getting ridiculous. But not as ridiculous as the big round bomb with the long fuse. It looks like the show is embracing the wacky hijinks of the 60s era Batman series. Or they&#8217;re just being stupid. After all, they assigned a bomb case to homicide detectives. And Nygma just stands around an evacuated building while he sets off a bomb and no-one notices. And Ivy shows up randomly for no reason. Bruce learns the importing fighting technique of getting beat up until someone else saves him. But the icing on this crap cake of an episode is when Penguin&#8217;s dad was cast as Penguin&#8217;s dad. While some might see this as a funny nod to the movie history of the franchise, it&#8217;s really just glaring spotlight on the fact that <em>Gotham</em> is a tv show. When things like this happen in a movie or tv show, it reminds viewers that they are watching something. It ruins the fragile reality of the fiction. But I can&#8217;t expect anything that happens in <em>Gotham</em> to make sense. Look at Thompkins. She goes from knowing that Jim is a murderer to professing his innocence. Did she just forget this fact during the commercial brake that lasted a month? Also, for a show that claims to be about the development of a larger mythos within a city, there are certainly a lot of gaps in the time line. What happened in that month? With villains sprouting up like weeds, <em>Gotham</em> has certainly gone to hell, right? But of course, the show is actually about Jim Gordon, so all that maters is what happens to him. Thus, it is a bit odd that for the second time, Jim has been shipped of in punishment. Maybe this sentence will be as short-lived as his exile to Arkham. Meanwhile, I am guessing that the show will either ignore the month delay or deliver lots of painful exposition about what happened. Probably the later.</p>

For the second time in Lucifer&#8217;s run, viewers have been graced (see what I did there?) with a bit of gorgeous piano music. This is easily the best part of the show and it has nothing to do with the thin and boring plot. Speaking of which, this episode tried very hard to be interesting but it just didn&#8217;t work. The show tried to inject some religious debate in an effort to get back to the core concept of the plot, but it felt forced and heavy-handed. Plus, it featured super angry Lucifer, which is not a good thing. The crime of the week was generally pointless, serving only as a vehicle for the rest of the story. Unfortunately, that story has lost its way. Lucifer dealing with his developing humanity is more of a prolonged temper tantrum. His interaction with Decker is a very lame and forced relationship. The mystery of Lucifer becoming human has been either ignored or forgotten. The side story focusing on the cop that Amenadiel brought back from the dead is a half-hearted attempt at making the story exciting, but it&#8217;s not enough. And the show itself seems to exist blandly on the screen. The actors seem to enjoy their roles well enough, but they&#8217;re just there. They don&#8217;t really deliver a performance that is exciting or dynamic. <em>Lucifer</em> is attempting to survive on a concept that isn&#8217;t fully developed.</p>

How many more episodes are left in this season? A few weeks ago, the Internet told me it was only a few, but now IMDb says it&#8217;s running through the end of May. I&#8217;m confused. But on another note&#8230;Bobby and Rufus! This was a great episode. It was a typical monster of the week, focusing on a single case and tossing in a few mentions of the season&#8217;s main plot. What made this episode so enjoyable was the back and forth between the two teams of hunters. This technique kept the show entertaining and exciting. The differences and similarities between the two cases was just plain fun. This episode was a throwback to the classic <em>Supernatural</em> style. It was refreshing to see the boys working a case simply for the sake of working a case. This is how <em>Supernatural</em> started way back when. Recent seasons have shifted their focus to the larger plot and tossed in the occasional hunt as filler. And while that still is true for this episode, the format used here made it feel different and better than the typical filler. But really, seeing Bobby and Rufus in action was the best part. Bobby was the foundation that kept the show running for several seasons. His death caused both the Winchesters and the show itself to lose focus. I hope that in the future, <em>Supernatural</em> gives us more episodes with this quality. I also hope that Sam and Dean can be given some sort of mentor that will keep them grounded and focused.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>iZombie &#8211; He Blinded Me&#8230;with Science<img class="size-medium wp-image-36728 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-8.00.28-PM-300x194.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-8.00.28-PM" width="300" height="194" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-8.00.28-PM-300x194.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-8.00.28-PM-298x192.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-8.00.28-PM.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
This episode started with some needed flashback, a good cooking montage, and Blaine being very entertaining. And that first segment title made me giggle. Du Clark also returned to the spotlight, which is a pleasure. The whole science brain narration running gag was a nice difference from the normal <em>iZombie</em> format. And speaking of gags, Liv getting to dress up as McIver was the type of meta joke that iZombie does well and is smart enough to not abuse. Of course, this part of the investigation got ruined immediately due to a pretty stupid move by Liv, which is disappointing for someone running on super scientist brains. Overall, this was an interesting episode. The case of the week faded into the background and let the episode focus on development of the actual plot. Several aspects of the complex <em>iZombie</em> plot were explored, but unlike other episodes where this happened, this was not confusing. The developments within the walls of Max Rager and with Blaine are adding some interesting elements to the plot. And with the show being renewed for season three, I can only imagine what this will all build towards. Blaine is the easily the best part of the show, so I cannot imagine him being removed from the plot. I also cannot imagine the show going the route of a full-blown zombie invasion, so I&#8217;m really not sure what will happen next. Overall, this was a great episode. The plot wasn&#8217;t confusing. The jokes were sharp. And there were some legitimate dramatic moments. I hope that this trend continues.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-36729 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cfbef286bd6749d5c98e8b7a6af918e0-300x169.jpg" alt="cfbef286bd6749d5c98e8b7a6af918e0" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cfbef286bd6749d5c98e8b7a6af918e0-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cfbef286bd6749d5c98e8b7a6af918e0.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cfbef286bd6749d5c98e8b7a6af918e0-298x168.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arrow &#8211; Broken Hearts</strong></span><br />
The majority of this episode was pointless. An old villain was brought back just to facilitate the drama of Felicity and Oliver. And she served absolutely no purpose other than stirring up said emotional drama. In the other story line, the courtroom drama was mildly interesting. But exposition and dialogue has never been a strength of <em>Arrow</em> and its cast, so this entire episode fell flat. Yes, this is a comic book show on the CW, which means there&#8217;s a double dose of drama injected into the script, but this episode was poorly written and executed. For almost four full season, Felicity and Oliver have been developing a relationship. While she is completely justified in deciding to walk away, the fact remains that by doing so, she is signing Team Arrow&#8217;s death warrant. It&#8217;s been proven time and time again during the course of the show that Felicity is a crucial element of their survival and success. By abandoning the team, she is leaving them helpless and broken. But <em>Arrow</em> is known for throwing a major crisis into the plot and resolving it almost instantly, so maybe it will all be fine next week. For the first time in awhile, I was more interested in the island flashback than what was happening in the main plot. If the Internet is correct and there are 7 more episodes left in this season, <em>Arrow</em> needs to kick itself back into gear and return to the type of story that it does best.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Flash &#8211; Trajectory<img class="size-medium wp-image-36730 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/3-jpg-300x201.jpg" alt="3-jpg" width="300" height="201" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/3-jpg-300x201.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/3-jpg.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/3-jpg-298x199.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
For being a genius, Wells is really stupid to give Jesse the watch that he used to record his creepy diary. But I don&#8217;t know if it was as stupid as the villain of the week speedster running in high heels. Minor complaints aside, this was a pretty good episode. There are some good jokes (especially the <em>Law &amp; Order</em> one) and the plot was entertaining. The drama was there, but not over the top. The big reveal at the end was the only thing that really bothered me. It seems like the team drew a lot of conclusions from fairly weak evidence. As viewers, we all knew that they were right. But it just seemed a little off for a group of scientists to make that kind of leap. But then again, this is a comic book show, and those types of conclusions happen all the time. I am looking forward to the continued conflict with Zoom. I&#8217;m excited to see how the fight kicks back off. Either the team or Zoom will have to open up the portals somehow. And with the new revelation about Zoom, there is certainly a limited time frame for this to occur. I am a little disappointed that Jesse is out of the picture for now. She could&#8217;ve provided a welcome addition to the team and helped break up the monotony of their interactions. I do still hope that she fulfills the easter egg hint and becomes a speedster at some point. <em>Flash</em> is better than other shows at keeping the main plot a factor even in event of the week style filler episodes. This fact, in addition to the strength of its writing staff and actors, has kept me engaged as a viewer. I am excited to see how this season wraps up.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to GeeklyInc&#8217;s Call of Cthulhu Living Campaign setting, New Coventry.</p>
<p>This Living Campaign is a series of articles where every author has an impact on the world. Articles can focus on any part of the setting, from locations to NPCs or even events. Writers can add new elements to the world or they can build upon what already has been defined. This will be a system-agnostic series, meaning that it will provide flavor and content instead of stat blocks and monster entries.</p>
<p>The intent of this series is to provide inspiration for home games. It will draw on foundational elements from Lovecraftian fiction as well as the horror and urban fantasy genres. The ideas presented can be utilized individually, or as a whole. As the setting develops and evolves, special articles will feature story lines within the established world. But all of the content in this series is simply fodder for additional development.</p>
<p>The specific boundaries and details of this campaign setting are intentionally vague. This is done so that all contributors have absolute freedom to create whatever they wish. Authors can add in any geographic details they want, from coastlines to mountains. The city itself might contain a university, manufacturing plants, shipping docks, or any number of physical locations. The general location and time frame will be the United States in the 1920s. However, the nature of this genre lends itself to a certain flexibility. Anything can, and might, happen.</p>
<p>And with the introduction complete&#8230;welcome to New Coventry.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Johnson&#8217;s Eatery &#8211; Location</span></p>
<p>This small-town diner sits just off the main drag in New Coventry. It&#8217;s best known for the breakfast specials that Ma Johnson serves all day long. As long as the Eatery has been around, Ma Johnson has been behind the counter, serving coffee and sharing her razor sharp wit.</p>
<p>Her boys, Hank and Crispin, work the grill and bus the tables. They&#8217;re quiet, hard workers. The boys are in their mid-twenties and have worked in the diner since before they were teenagers. Hank has dreams of being a writer, and spends what little free time he has in the town&#8217;s library. Crispin is much more focused on the business and is constantly trying to get his mother to upgrade and improve the restaurant.</p>
<p>But Ma Johnson is set in her ways and the restaurant does not suffer for it. The counter is long and sits a dozen at its stools. There are a few booths in the back and a handful of small tables scattered through the main dining area.</p>
<p>The restaurant is most busy at lunch. Workers from all over New Coventry cram into the Eatery, consuming patty melts, meatloaf, and cold deli sandwiches. Ma Johnson&#8217;s famous breakfast bake is served hot and fresh all day, delivering that hearty, stick to your ribs meal that keeps the population of New Coventry happy and full. Dinner is not very busy, but many people stop by for hot coffee and fresh apple pie for desert.</p>
<p>Ma Johnson seems to know everything that happens in New Coventry. She&#8217;s the best source for town gossip. But she also has a keen insight into all types of issues and usually offers sound advice. That advice isn&#8217;t free, but it can be bought for a meal. The one thing she won&#8217;t share, however, is her recipe book.</p>
<p>Johnson&#8217;s Eatery is an institution of New Coventry. Everyone is welcomed and treated equally. It&#8217;s a place to eat, socialize, and converse. Of course, if your&#8217;e not careful, someone will certainly overhear what you&#8217;re talking about. Which might not always be a good thing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was eleven years old, I wanted a lot from the world.  I wanted my first Pokemon, and my Hogwarts Letter, but most of all I wanted a magical animal to come tell me I was destined to fight evil in a pretty outfit.  Somewhere in there I was probably going to fit in a little sleep.  Young Steph had her priorities figured out.  </span></p>
<div id="attachment_36190" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-36190" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sleepingusagi2-300x224.jpg" alt="Alright, maybe a bit more sleep." width="300" height="224" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sleepingusagi2-300x224.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sleepingusagi2-298x222.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sleepingusagi2.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Steph, circa 1999.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will surprise absolutely nobody who knows me than I have a bit of thing for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://geeklyinc.com/?s=sailor+moon&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">Sailor Moon</a></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  I was about 6 when I saw my first episode, and it would come to be my first major pop culture obsession.  At that time my family didn’t have cable, so my grandparents would tape episodes for us and mail the tapes to the other side of the country for us.  Or we would go to the video store (RIP 5 Star Video) and rent the same two episodes over and over.  It’s safe to say that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permanently rewired my young brain to adore anything and everything related to what I now know as Magical Girls.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magical Girl typically refers to anime, where the term was coined and the genre is most pervasive, but there are other examples as well.  Magical Girl shows feature young girls, typically 10-17 years old, who are given magical powers and a mission to fight evil.  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon, The Powerpuff Girls</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all fall under the umbrella of Magical Girl.  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally the Witch</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is often considered to be the first Magical Girl anime, which in turn drew its inspiration from the American show </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bewitched</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  The shows often feature girls dealing with a balance between real life and their magic duties, which they have no ability to opt out of.  Schoolwork, romance, family life, all while keeping their secret identity just that, a secret, become a major part of plot.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36279" style="width: 269px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-36279" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/usagieating-1.jpeg" alt="Picture: An important part of saving the day." width="259" height="194" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pictured: An important part of saving the day.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though few shows bring it up explicitly, there are obvious parallels between the physical and emotional changes of puberty with the changes Magical Girls go through.  Physical transformation is often a component of being a Magical Girl, with the transformed versions of the characters being instantly bestowed with grace and knowledge their untransformed selves don’t have.  Usagi Tsukino is a lazy crybaby, but when transformed into Sailor Moon she is (mostly) a mighty warrior for justice who always has a clever quip ready to throw at an enemy.  Children often believe adulthood just comes with magical knowledge of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to adult</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which as a mostly self identifying adult I now know to not be true.  You can talk to all the cats in the world, but none of them are going to teach you how not to burn spaghetti.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also can’t talk Magical Girls without talking about what the genre has done for feminism, particularly for young girls watching TV.  Young Steph didn’t realize how lucky she was to find a female driven superhero show at the tender age of 6, because for a long time such a thing just did not exist outside the Magical Girl genre.  Magical Girl shows literally empower the characters with the ability to fight evil and kick ass while being female.  Femininity isn’t seen as a weakness, but a weapon, and traditionally feminine traits like strong emotions become a power source.  Shows also typically feature ensemble casts, giving watchers the ability to identify with at least one character rather than just the single token female character on other shows.  The ensemble cast also means most shows give a strong value on friendship and teamwork, with girls working together rather than competing against each other.</p>
<div id="attachment_36280" style="width: 230px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-36280" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sailorteam-220x300.jpg" alt="Teamwork makes the dream work." width="220" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sailorteam-220x300.jpg 220w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sailorteam-298x407.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sailorteam.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Teamwork makes the dream work.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m vastly glossing over the intricacies of the Magical Girl genre right now because I’ll be talking about it in much more detail over the course of this column.  Each month I’ll be watching a new Magical Girl show and discussing it in detail.  I’ll be talking about how each show fits into the themes of Magical Girl, and how they relate to each other.  So stay tuned for the first installment which will be on (no surprises here): Sailor Moon!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blindspot &#8211; Erase Weary Youth<img class="size-medium wp-image-36638 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/16_NUP_171818_0896-300x200.jpg" alt="Blindspot" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/16_NUP_171818_0896-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/16_NUP_171818_0896-768x512.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/16_NUP_171818_0896-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/16_NUP_171818_0896-620x414.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/16_NUP_171818_0896.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
As bottle episodes go, this was pretty entertaining. But as with all bottle episodes, nothing was resolved and the story did not move forward. Fisher was removed as a quasi-villain, which I think was a good move. He was extremely one-dimensional and frustrating. Ultimately, his purpose was to cause problems within the team, and that was successfully accomplished. I think his existence could&#8217;ve been better served to deliver some actual information. <em>Blindspot</em> viewers are constantly asked to wait. This show is all about delayed gratification. Luckily, the show has enough quality to make this wait worthwhile. However, I would appreciate some payoff along the way. Just like gambling, a tiny reveal of info goes a long way to keeping viewers engaged as the ultimate mystery solution is approached. <em>Blindspot</em> certainly knows how to do this. So I wish that it would&#8217;ve been done with Fisher. It would&#8217;ve been very easy to have him reveal some new piece of information during his quest to take down Jane and the FBI team. Instead, this episode was simple filler. It did a great job of creating tension and drama. That interrogation montage was intense. But nothing else happened. I guess that this episode was about making ripples in the pond.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-36639 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GothamBall-600x377-300x189.png" alt="GothamBall-600x377" width="300" height="189" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GothamBall-600x377-300x189.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GothamBall-600x377.png 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GothamBall-600x377-298x187.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Gotham &#8211; This Ball of Mud and Meanness</strong></span><br />
Oh Tank Girl, you&#8217;ve made me so sad. <em>Gotham</em> is sinking further and further into insanity, becoming a cartoon parody of itself. A punk club dedicated to the kid who wasn&#8217;t Joker. Really? But Petty was rather fantastic in her small role. It wasn&#8217;t enough  to redeem <em>Gotham</em>, but nothing is. I didn&#8217;t care about anything that happened in this episode. It&#8217;s taken two years to get to the point that we all knew would happen in the very first episode&#8230;Bruce living on the street with Selena to &#8220;learn the ropes&#8221; of crime and survival. Or something. The showdown with Malone was absolutely the worst thing the show could&#8217;ve done. Obviously, <em>Gotham</em> has no connection to the actual Batman mythology. Taking away the ability for an adult Bruce to face down his parents&#8217; killer after he&#8217;s become Batman destroys one of the greatest and most impactful stories ever told. The thing with Penguin made no sense. Sure, it&#8217;s about Strange and whatever he&#8217;s doing, but it didn&#8217;t fit into the episode. It was a side story that was just shoehorned into the episode because it had to happen. <em>Gotham</em> has no sense of pacing or skilled storytelling. The thing with Nygma was almost interesting. But it was really just one big forced development of the Riddler story. This was a dull, pointless episode. Plus, the dialogue seemed to be heavy on the badly written side. There were several repetitive moments and lots of contradictions. And the heavy-handed ending about Bruch becoming Batman was not necessary. It came across as if the writers felt that the audience forgot about this part of the story and had to squeeze it back in there. Well, who&#8217;s fault is that?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lucifer &#8211; Et Tu, Doctor<img class="size-medium wp-image-36640 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lucifer_1.08_et_tu_doctor_principal-300x168.png" alt="Lucifer_1.08_et_tu_doctor_principal" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lucifer_1.08_et_tu_doctor_principal-300x168.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lucifer_1.08_et_tu_doctor_principal-298x167.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lucifer_1.08_et_tu_doctor_principal.png 615w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
This episode starts with the most lame and un-energetic party I&#8217;ve ever seen. Did any tell the extras what to do beyond stand around and sway out of time with the music?  The crime of the week format is back in full swing with this episode, and I could care less. It was just the vehicle to get Lucifer talking about emotions, and I don&#8217;t care about that. It&#8217;s a weak part of the story. Really, the story has just stalled out. This fact is supported by the return to the Palmetto case. This has nothing to do with Lucifer or his shenanigans. But the show needs something to keep itself going. Unfortunately, the concept of Lucifer kicking around LA and maybe becoming human or maybe suffering something else with a detective that might not be human (even though that has been ignored for weeks) isn&#8217;t enough to it be a complete show. Compared to the rest of <em>Lucifer</em>, this wasn&#8217;t a bad episode. But that&#8217;s not saying much for a show that is nothing but mediocre. Jim Rash showing up randomly was cool, but he was criminally underused, so it was a waste of a guest star, in my opinion. I never expected <em>Lucifer</em> to be good, but I hoped that the writers would at least try to put out an interesting show. At this point, I hope that <em>Lucifer</em> becomes yet another failed Fox program.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to another Geekly Game Lab. Today we will be spending time with <em>Salt and Sanctuary</em> from Ska Studios. Now, <em>Salt and Sanctuary</em> is best described as a 2D Souls game. You have punishing difficulty, big and mean bosses all topped with losing your earned currency when you die. But, <em>Salt and Sanctuary</em> does so much to make sure that this style of game survives its transition to the 2D world. The whole thing feels great from the very beginning and I cannot wait to play more.</p>

<h5>Synopsis from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Drunks_and_Dragons_Episodes">Drunks and Dragons Wiki</a>:</h5>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Having slaughtered Hookbeard and his innocent crew, creating 19 orphans, our heroes free the slaves, despite knowing they could sell them for G1000 each. <a title="Ros" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Ros">Ros</a> informs the team of a sea monster in the area before realizing that they are significantly off course. Aludra offers to help by acting as lookout and Ros accuses her of sexism. Suddenly the team hears &#8220;WOOMF!&#8221; and the boat shakes so violently that Junpei and Aludra are thrown to the ground. A giant <a title="Kraken" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Kraken">Kraken</a> has grabbed the ship. Aludra is inspired by his &#8220;wise eyes.&#8221; Ros and the other crew retreat below decks. Everyone is dissapointed to find that the cannons on the Roll20 map don&#8217;t actually exist. Three tentacles on either side of the boat grip the vessel while two loom menacingly overhead near the exposed kraken&#8217;s head&#8230;</span></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hope&#8217;s brother is a meth addict. He once had a promising future as a hockey player, but now he&#8217;s a meth addict, and she&#8217;s leaving for boarding school to get away from him, even though all she really wants is to help him. All Eric, her brother, really wants is to stay high. That&#8217;s the only way to keep his secret at bay.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no preamble for a book like this because there&#8217;s no preamble in this book. Its not sugarcoated. It&#8217;s not a slow descent and a slow redemption&#8211;it starts at the bottom and only gets sadder and more complicated. But despite that&#8211;or perhaps because of its frankness&#8211;it&#8217;s never maudlin. There are hard choices, but the characters don&#8217;t sit around bemoaning them. They make them, sometimes wedging secrets further between them, and sometimes prying those secrets loose.</p>
<p>The book veered at times between true YA and something more middle-grade. The themes were certainly mature, with certain scenes wrenchingly explicit, but other aspects were surprisingly naive. Eric&#8217;s journey is profoundly wretched, full of the most awful deprivation and desperation. He lives in filth but sells any food and clothing at a meager price, hoping only to score. Meanwhile, Hope&#8217;s desperate romance with a boy she meets on the internet is an interesting counterpoint, ensconced as she is in a wealthy boarding school.  I wonder if the author wanted to juxtapose innocence with innocence lost, or raw misery with austere fantasy.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-36555" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/25845053.jpg" alt="25845053" width="297" height="475" /></p>
<p>The contrast is a little too strong at some points, and I do have to wonder how a teenager could fall for some mysterious internet boyfriend so easily. Yes, she&#8217;s alone and dealing with a broken family, and it makes sense to a certain extent that she would be overeager for any kind of support. It also makes sense that she would fall into an unhealthy relationship, given the abusive tirades and bottomless need she gets from her brother. But teens who are exposed to miserable realities are often more savvy, not less. I can certainly see arguments either way, but I was not entirely convinced by the narrative. I think twenty more pages of description and psychology could have cinched it for me, especially in a book that&#8217;s otherwise so efficient. A mere 200 pages is not a lot for this subject, especially now that Rowling the Great has proven that children and teens will read 500 or 800 just as cheerfully.</p>
<p>Is this a book for children, or teens, though? Usually I ignore age suggestions, since I don&#8217;t have children and I was myself a precocious and bitter child, eager for a more grown-up fantasy world that reflected my unhappy reality. Protecting children from maturity is not my place. I firmly believe that children should have the chance to read books that might be challenge or disturb them. But this book does raise questions I am not fully able to answer, since <em>Finding Hope </em>is at times shockingly candid. Would I have been able to handle this book when I was younger? Not easily, and maybe not at all. Did I find it compelling now, in what I suppose must be adulthood? Yes, absolutely. This may well be a new breed of YA, something meant for the contingent of us who never stopped reading it, but who also moved on past high school. It&#8217;s painful, and without pretension.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also filled with poetry. Now, be warned: I am extremely picky about my poetry. I&#8217;ve studied T.S. Eliot and Shakespeare at Oxford; I read it in my spare time. So I have some idea what I&#8217;m talking about when I say that this is some good poetry. Like the narrative, it&#8217;s raw. It&#8217;s rough. The brevity and formlessness of each poem makes them urgent and a bit wild. I can believe that a teenager wrote it, but that&#8217;s not a disparagement, it&#8217;s just a testament to Colleen Nelson&#8217;s ability to create strong voices for her characters. If I were a teenager, I would have written a few of these out to layer on my walls, just like Hope does.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m an adult, and I still read YA. I still think that this age, and books about it, is potent and meaningful, and both Hope and Eric&#8217;s journeys are particularly excellent examples of this. YA nerds both of the intended audience or the adult geek variety will find something bittersweet and ultimately hopeful here.</p>
<p><em>Finding Hope </em>will be released March 19.</p>

<p>Four is really the meat and potatoes of board gaming.  Two couples get together for dinner and after dinner amusement.  Mom and Dad break out Monopoly with the kids on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  A quartet of unfortunately single dudes at College on a typical Saturday night&#8230;</p>
<p>Many games are designed for four, or at the very least play best with four.  Walk into your FLGS and you&#8217;ll find no shortage of great games &#8211; Classics like Ticket to Ride, Settler&#8217;s of Catan, and Carcassone, all play best with four.  Here are a few others that might fit the bill for your next game night:</p>

<p>Like I said there are TONS of great games for four &#8211; what are your favorites?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>It&#8217;s another short roster of new shows this week. Come on CW, I need the good stuff to come back. Wow, I never thought I&#8217;d be longing for quality from the CW. Speaking of which, the internet tells me that the CW DC shows and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">iZombie</span> are all being renewed for another season. This should prove interesting as the season finales of all of these shows approach.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blindspot &#8211; Scientists Hollow Fortune<img class="size-medium wp-image-36534 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NUP_171728_0792-300x186.jpg" alt="Blindspot - Season 1" width="300" height="186" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NUP_171728_0792-300x186.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NUP_171728_0792-298x185.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NUP_171728_0792.jpg 612w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
Oh! I finally figured out something about decoding the tattoos. I feel stupid for not putting it together until now. Patterson has most of the tattoos decoded, or at least partially figured out, and then she connects them to an event as it happens. This makes the suspension of disbelief easier to handle. I enjoyed this episode. It had great, exciting action. Every character got a bit of time in the spotlight. The drama was a little heavy-handed, but it worked well with the rest of the show. The scene with Weller and his father, on the other hand, was very real and intense. It was a much-needed development in his character arc. And Jane&#8217;s flashbacks made a return, which is a very important part of the plot. <em>Blindspot</em> is about a slow reveal of facts. The plot is moving forward to explore new facts, but the past is crucial to the show&#8217;s continuation. Even though the flashbacks don&#8217;t give viewers too much information, they do serve to keep everyone focused on the mystery. Speaking of which, the return to Orion was very intriguing. Honestly, I had forgotten about that clue over the winter break. Bringing it back now means that the show is actually moving towards the home stretch. I&#8217;m sure that no real truths will be told anytime soon, but it&#8217;s getting there. I think that the most important part of this episode was Weller&#8217;s line about seeing only good guys and bad guys. His attitude is, unfortunately, unique when compared to the other characters. Every other character lives in a world of grey. Some secrets are minor, some are huge and directly related to the plot. But Weller is the most open and direct character in the show, making his views of good or bad clear. Jane, as his direct counterpart, is learning that nothing can be so clear-cut. This is a simple dynamic, but it&#8217;s very important to the success of the show. Jane exists as to challenge Weller&#8217;s views and understanding. He is trying to fit this whole adventure into his perception of things. I am sure that ultimately, he will be forced to change. The first instance of that was in the scene with his father. The ending scene with the mysterious quest-giver was just as frustrating as I figured it would be. There is an implication of a mole within the FBI. That could prove interesting. There is still no reason for Jane to believe or follow along with this guy. But that fits in with the recurring theme of Jane simply being a tool used by everyone else she encounters. Overall, the show is successful in leaving me wanting more. I am always excited by the facts that Blindspot reveals and aways anxious tor whatever comes next. I just hope that the final reveal is worth the wait. And that it&#8217;s not something lame, like it all being a training exercise.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-36535 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gotham213-600x335-300x168.jpg" alt="Gotham213-600x335" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gotham213-600x335-300x168.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gotham213-600x335.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gotham213-600x335-298x166.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Gotham &#8211; A Dead Man Feels No Cold</strong></span><br />
This episode features the return of horrible CG and baby Bruce, who is growing up way faster than the time line of the show would allow. Although Thompkins is suddenly extremely pregnant, so maybe the time line of <em>Gotham</em> is a fluid as its setting. For some unknown reason, Doctor Thompkins is playing psychiatrist. And just in case the audience woke up stupid, the writers smacked us in the face repeatedly with the dual nature of Bruce. Because that totally developed when he was a kid. Right. The intro scene with the results of Fries&#8217; rampage made no sense. Seeing the classic frozen bullet was fine, but there are randomly shards of ice being thrown? Where did that come from? Apparently, Fries is inventing crazy new tech all over the place. This also reinforces the fact that <em>Gotham</em> is a cartoon that throws physics and reality right out the window. All of this demonstrates that <em>Gotham</em> is nothing but a collection of random, unconnected, illogical, nonsensical ideas. It&#8217;s like the writers just throw darts at a wall of ideas and then cram all of the results into an episode. For claiming that Arkham is more secure, Fries walks in without any difficulty. The whole &#8220;use the bus to block the gate&#8221; might have worked if it was actually in front of the gate. The Freeze suit shows up for absolutely no reason. And it looks ridiculous. It only exists to make him a costume villain. Professor Strange is a giggling maniac. Which fits with the fact that his inmates wander around with trash in their hair. Seriously. What idiot not only wrote this script, but approved it? Who pitched the idea of &#8220;the only want to demonstrate insanity is to have people wander around giggling after we&#8217;ve put them in stupid wigs&#8221;? Fire that person immediately. Really, just fire everyone and cancel the show. What was the implication at the end? Is Galavan being cloned? And was that supposed to be an alien or just some random mutation earlier in the cell? Again, nothing in Gotham makes sense or follows a logical plot line. I liked seeing the nod to Ace Chemicals. That&#8217;s how an element of the larger mythos should be handled. Making it part of Wayne Enterprises is an odd choice, but it relates back to the show&#8217;s attempt to make this company the source of all of Gotham&#8217;s problems. For all of my personal dislike of the show, I&#8217;ve tried to watch it analytically. But this episode was just a nonsensical mess.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lucifer &#8211; Wingman<img class="size-medium wp-image-36536 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/177-300x186.png" alt="177" width="300" height="186" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/177-300x186.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/177-768x475.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/177-298x184.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/177-620x384.png 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/177.png 769w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
I really don&#8217;t know what to think when a show hands out exposition then reprimands itself for doing so. But I really love that blue tux. Yowza. I wanted to enjoy the concept of a black market auction for religious relics. It wasn&#8217;t handled as well as it could&#8217;ve been. And the end result was predictable. If the wings are going to be a driving element of the rest of the show, they can&#8217;t turn up so fast. Except when they do. So never mind. As much as I enjoy Ellis&#8217; performance, when he goes all crazy possessive devil, it&#8217;s not very good. This was an odd episode. It delivered two separate stories, and wasn&#8217;t a crime of the week buddy cop show like every other episode so far. I liked this change. The show was still cheesy and overly dramatic, but it was entertaining. However, that drama was really over the top. Everything with Lucifer and his angel buddies was ridiculously forced. Although the more casual exchanges between him and Amenadiel were funny. The detective side of things was even worse. Procedural police dramas need that kind of lucky happenstance, but it just didn&#8217;t work in this episode. Decker and her ex are not well-developed characters beyond their dysfunctional relationship. And this episode adds yet another element to the story. Multiple plot arcs can work in genre shows, but they have to be handled carefully. This new element comes into the show halfway through the the short premier season. That might not be the best idea. But the core premise isn&#8217;t really making any forward movement, so it might work out. I don&#8217;t dislike Lucifer, but it isn&#8217;t a great show. It will probably end on a major cliff hanger paired with the introduction of a new supernatural element or character. As usual, I&#8217;m looking forward to what happens, even it it&#8217;s not the best.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-36537 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lot-20108-300x200.jpg" alt="Night of the Hawk" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lot-20108-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lot-20108.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lot-20108-298x199.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Legends of Tomorrow &#8211; Night of the Hawk<br />
</strong></span>This episode was not typical, for <em>Legends</em>. It still had the inter-personal drama and quips, but the action was all shifted to the end, and even those scenes were pretty short. The focus of the show was not the team. Instead, the show attempted to focus on their interaction with the inhabitants of the 50s era town that the McGuffin of a clue from last week pointed them towards. I say &#8220;attempted&#8221; because it didn&#8217;t work out as well as it could have. But it was a valiant effort. I think that this was intended to be a &#8220;culture shock&#8221; episode. The team needed to see that rampaging through time isn&#8217;t just adventures and punching. There are opportunities for emotional connection and real learning experiences. If that sounded pretty cheesy, you&#8217;re right. It was about as cheesy and forced as this episode. And that&#8217;s not a bad thing. <em>Legends</em> is the most comic book show of the CW super hero block, and all comic books at some point have the public service announcement issue. It was still a great episode. And it featured the &#8220;characters get into cool fights in period costumes&#8221; trope, which is entertaining. Savage&#8217;s plan was confusing and ill-defined. It really felt like his appearance in the episode was an afterthought. Yes, he&#8217;s the driving factor of the show, but he didn&#8217;t add anything of value to this particular episode. He had a little showdown with Hawkgirl, but only demonstrated that nothing has changed and nothing will change until the plot needs it to happen. We all know that there&#8217;s no chance of a successful encounter with Savage until the season finale, at least. That&#8217;s how comic books work. There&#8217;s even a possibility that the team will continue to chase Savage after this season wraps, with the renewal announced. But I hope that this is not what happens. Savage is a great DC character, but he&#8217;s best used as a background villain. He needs to be in the shadows, not the spotlight. Reveal him pulling the strings of other villains and plots, sure, but he should not be the focus until the third act climax. <em>Legends</em> has the potential to incorporate almost any DC hero and villain. I don&#8217;t want to see the quality foundation off the show squandered by only dealing with Savage. Overall, this episode proved that the cast and crew can handle a script with some depth, and that&#8217;s very good for the future of the show.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having survived his ordeals, Nathan is now trying to survive his own success: he found his father and received his Three Gifts, and found his special talent as a witch, but that power is not so easily controlled. Nathan is a shapeshifter, but he can barely control the creature within him, let alone what&#8217;s going on in the wider world while he practices and waits. Gabriel is missing, feared dead, and Annalise is the prisoner of the weather witch Mercury. The Hunters are after all of them and more besides&#8211;every potential ally, including Nathan&#8217;s own father, has gone to ground. If Nathan hopes to survive in this warzone of a world, he has to start understanding himself and unraveling the machinations of the White Council. And unfortunately, he also has to start compromising. How he does so, and by how much, accounts for as much a drama as the action (and there&#8217;s plenty of action), making this one of the most interesting YA series I&#8217;ve read in some time.</p>
<p>This volume lacks the pointed rage at injustice and brutality that made the first book so incisive. But that quality led to a certain lack of agency on Nathan&#8217;s part, the sense that he was being swept along by events that were beyond his understanding and his ability to affect. At best, he faced choices between bad and worse, or between desperate and despairing. This made for a compelling psychological development, but it&#8217;s not sustainable over a trilogy. Fortunately, Green realized this. Nathan has found his footing in Half Wild and is able to make both decisions about his autonomy and morality.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-36447" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20814989.jpg" alt="20814989" width="317" height="475" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20814989.jpg 317w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20814989-200x300.jpg 200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20814989-298x447.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /></p>
<p>Most symbolic of those choices is the love triangle between Nathan, Gabriel, and Annalise. Nathan is unsure about a relationship with a man, but Gabriel accepts everything about him, even his darkness and his Black Witch side. Annalise, on the other hand, is pure and gentle and appeals to his White Witch side. But sides in this story are tricky, and people never quite stay within the lines. I am firmly Team Nathabriel as I believe 99.9% of readers are. Oh, sure, Annalise is endearing in her own way, but Nathan can&#8217;t share himself with her. She may inspire him to be good, and she may believe in his good side, but she&#8217;s on a pedestal and she&#8217;s not coming down into the real world. And this book is very much about the real world, for all that it features witches. Heads and hearts get broken. It&#8217;s nice to have a protagonist who understands this so much better than most; who can really stand in for the horrible things people have to go through while still trying to form bonds of friendship and love.</p>
<p>To compare it once again to the Harry Potter universe, the Half Bad series is a far darker, more adult take. Any daring missions and skin-of-their-teeth escapes are earned with blood and fear, and often with death. So many people die, and their deaths feel poignant because of their swift pointlessness. In several instances I found Rowling&#8217;s death scenes lacking in both poignancy and message. Here, death feels real and awful; it comes swiftly and leaves a wreckage in its wake, both in the emotional and physical senses. It made me almost physically ill to think of the cost of war, all those dead children. As it should. Green makes the tolls of war palpable in her descriptions but also in the way Nathan objects so strenuously to them. He doesn&#8217;t want to kill. He hates it. But he must.</p>
<p>So often in movies and books I have to suspend disbelief that the Bad Guys (and, for that matter, the Good Guys too) wouldn&#8217;t just shoot someone off the bat to deal with the threat. Green, however, never relies on mercy or monologing. She doesn&#8217;t use any crutches at all, in fact. Lives in her books are brutish and short, so much so that you can genuinely fear for most characters. In that sense, this is less Harry Potter and more YA George R. R. Martin. This is definitely the Storm of Swords equivalent, complete with a Red Wedding-esque slaughter and a whole lot of wolves. Fortunately, since the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Half-Lost-Bad-Trilogy/dp/0670017140/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457565793&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=half+lost">last book</a> is coming out in just a few weeks (!) you won&#8217;t have to wait as agonizingly long for what I hope and pray is an awesome conclusion.</p>
<p>And o hai, there&#8217;s a giveaway too: <a id="rcwidget_cwniy6o3" class="rcptr" href="http://www.rafflecopter.com/rafl/display/69b4351129/" rel="nofollow" data-raflid="69b4351129" data-theme="classic" data-template="5627e93058b80d6e0b616d91">a Rafflecopter giveaway</a><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My job takes me all over the nation. Sometimes I’m chatting with auto-workers in the Great Lakes region, others I’m standing in the plains of southern Oklahoma talking to some fella about oil patch work. With few exceptions, the conversation starts with the decline in skilled labor, circles to the price of metal, before ultimately coming to the following exchange. “Wow, Patrick, you sure are tall, handsome, and also cool. I’ve heard you have awesome hats. You’ve given me such great advice. What I really want to know is&#8230;what are the rad video games?” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I tell these folks the same thing I&#8217;ll tell y&#8217;all, all of them. All of the video games are rad. Sometimes, however, you have to go into the past to find one that really speaks to you.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36452" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-36452 size-medium" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0444-225x300.jpg" alt="picture of cool hat as proof as aforementioned cool hats." width="225" height="300" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0444-225x300.jpg 225w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0444-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0444-900x1200.jpg 900w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0444-298x397.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0444-620x827.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">picture of cool hat as proof of aforementioned cool hats.</p></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As we find ourselves in the late Q1 early Q2 annual dearth of new games, I decided to head into my backlog to see if there was anything I’d missed out on in the last 15 months or so. Lo and behold, <em>The Evil Within</em> still sat on my shelf, unplayed. With nothing in the near future demanding my attention, I decided to give it a whirl. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The nice thing about <em>Evil Within</em> is that it’s the best <em>Resident Evil</em> game I’ve ever played. It obviously controls better than the Playstation 1 <em>Resident Evil</em> games, but it has that same sense of constant tension. There is even a nice little <em>Resident Evil:1</em> allusion in chapter 2 that was much appreciated. <em>Evil Within</em> is able to capture the ever present sense of dread the early <em>Resident Evil </em>games had. The jump scares have been minimal, regardless I’ve been kept on the edge of my </span><span class="s1">seat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With limited time before newer games arrive, I decided to play the game on the “casual” setting to get a sense of story and zip through the campaign without frustration. The nice thing is that, while not difficult, ammo is still quite scare on this setting and has really made me question whether it is worth it to gun down the enemies I encounter or sneak/run past them. The casual setting allows me to progress at a nice clip while still offering challenges here and there. The boss fights can still present a test, while not being too maddening. The story on the other hand is, murky at best.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The main goal, as I hinted at in the paragraph above, of my <em>Evil Within</em> play through was to get a tight, linear experience with a compelling story. Maybe the story is compelling, I wouldn&#8217;t know. I thought <em>Dark Souls/Bloodborne</em> were alone in how obtuse their story telling is. Well, <em>Evil Within</em> certainly took a page out of the FromSoftware playbook here. I’ve played well over half of the game and still have no clue what the hell is going on. I know the main character and player avatar, Sebastian, looks like Jamie Lannister’s brunette brother and wears a vest. He has a friend who also wears a vest, named Joseph. Only Joseph also wears cool leather gloves.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36454" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-36454 size-large" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TEW_big_Seb-1006x1200.jpg" alt="If you image search Sebastian and Jospeh, the Evil Within, you get some real aggressive fan fiction pictures." width="620" height="740" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TEW_big_Seb-1006x1200.jpg 1006w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TEW_big_Seb-252x300.jpg 252w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TEW_big_Seb-768x916.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TEW_big_Seb-298x355.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TEW_big_Seb-620x739.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TEW_big_Seb.jpg 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">If you image search Sebastian and Jospeh, <em>T</em><em>he Evil Within</em>, you get some real aggressive, yaoi,fan fiction pictures.</p></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seems like this is going to be a pretty straight forward spook fest. The game opens with our man Seb and his pal Joseph, the gloved one, investigating a hospital where a rude dude has run amok. It’s a blood bath when you open those doors, bodies everywhere. Watch some security footage, see some super natural stuff, ghost man pops up behind you. Fade to black. You wake up in the basement/human butcher shop where a slop monster is chopping up fresh corpses. Full disclosure, I died a ton here because I didn’t realize the glowing object near the butcher table was a set of keys, I thought it was a lamp. That’s on me.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36455" style="width: 857px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-36455" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Butcher.jpg" alt="there they are, on the hook to the left. " width="847" height="473" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Butcher.jpg 847w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Butcher-300x168.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Butcher-768x429.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Butcher-298x166.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Butcher-620x346.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">there they are, on the hook to the left.</p></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anyway, you free yourself from this basement and get a cool credits scene. Finish running through the hospital and get outside, free from the meat man and rude dude ghost boy. Nothing makes sense from this point forward. I guess the meat boy and ghost man decided to cause an earthquake? Either way, you hop in an ambulance and THE ENTIRE CITY crumbles and is swallowed by the earth. The ambulance jettisons off a cliff, but it’s cool, everyone inside survives. You gain control of Sebastian in some spooky woods. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before too long there is an outhouse you stumble into as warbled music bleeds from a cracked mirror, which is totally normal. You get sucked into the mirror and end up in a derelict mental hospital. I’m not sure if this is the past, present, or in my characters head as there is no real context as to what’s happening. There is a nurse, who while polite, couldn’t be less interested in her job or my well being. This weird hospital area acts as a safe house. There are these cracked mirrors through the game that you can jump into and save. You can also level up your stats in this place by sitting in an electric chair and injecting yourself with globules of green goo you siphon from the corpses of your enemies.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36456" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-36456" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/d4d9a87b9c55dbe2705ac0de2d8354df.png" alt="sitting in the slime chair" width="600" height="347" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/d4d9a87b9c55dbe2705ac0de2d8354df.png 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/d4d9a87b9c55dbe2705ac0de2d8354df-300x174.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/d4d9a87b9c55dbe2705ac0de2d8354df-298x172.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">sitting in the slime chair</p></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I could go on, but I’ve confused myself even more just trying to explain it. All that being said, I’m having a blast with this game. I love the environment, the boss fights, the ammo scarcity etc. The game is gruesome, the death animations have made me uncomfortable more than once, and some of the boss characters are truly terrifying. If you are looking for a quick game to play before the big console releases this summer, give <em>Evil Within</em> a whirl. Regardless, please watch the video of this delightful asian gentleman record the sound effects for the game. If we all loved our jobs this much.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Confession time: I resisted and disdained this book at first because the first chapter and a smattering of other sections are in the second person. And I <em>hate </em>that. There&#8217;s nothing more irritating than wanting a narrative and getting an experiment&#8211;it&#8217;s as if the author is dangling a story just out of reach and is instead pelting you with bullshit, capering around yodeling &#8220;look what I can do&#8221; like a deranged MFA student. Congratulations, you&#8217;ve discovered the second person singular. Not many people use it. <em>For a reason</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not entirely fond of the second person usage here, but I got over it because the rest is <em>phenomenal</em>. Nathan&#8217;s voice is one of the rawest I&#8217;ve ever read, full of innocence betrayed and misdirected fury. He&#8217;s a lost child; he&#8217;s a canny schemer; he&#8217;s a wounded creature; he&#8217;s a gentle young man. He is as many contradictions as teenagers ever are, all turned up to 11.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-36442" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/18079804.jpg" alt="18079804" width="317" height="475" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/18079804.jpg 317w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/18079804-200x300.jpg 200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/18079804-298x447.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /></p>
<p>Nathan is a Half Code, half White witch and half Black witch thanks to his father, the most feared Black witch in England (and possibly the world). Nathan&#8217;s never met this villainous legend, but that doesn&#8217;t stop almost everyone from assuming he&#8217;ll follow the same path. The supreme Council of White Witches restricts his movements and leaves the threat of their judgment hanging over him; the other White witches in his town hate and torment him; even his own sister schemes to find proof of his innate wickedness.</p>
<p>But Nathan isn&#8217;t bad. Angry, sure, and frightened, but he&#8217;s just as eager for acceptance as any other child. And he finds kindness with his gran and his other siblings, who do their best to support and shield him. They can&#8217;t protect him for long, though. Nathan will end up in prison, in a cage, and in fear for both his freedom and his life before it&#8217;s all over, and there&#8217;s precious little anyone who loves him can do. It&#8217;s up to him to find the courage and resilience to endure&#8211;and more, to determine how he will respond if and when he finally gets free.</p>
<p>This book is like Harry Potter if Gryffindor and Slytherin were identifiable by physical attributes rather than just the content of their character, and if most Gryffindors were fascists. Oh, sure, Black witches can be self-serving, conniving, and yeah, evil, but White witches are united in their blind hatred. They&#8217;re bent on extermination and control, brooking no disagreement or mitigation, and that&#8217;s a far scarier thing. No megalomaniac or serial killer will ever be as frightening or cruel as the serried ranks of people convinced they&#8217;re angels.</p>
<p>(If you&#8217;re into MTG, White and Black here really match well to the color philosophies. But I&#8217;ll leave that for our resident Magic expert @cutefuzzy_ to explain.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to craft a world of such brutal injustice that feels both insane and reasonable: insane to a normal person, but reasonable to someone under the sway of some kind of obsessive ideology. Green nails it here. I was up in arms over Nathan&#8217;s treatment, which was heart wrenching but never gratuitous. It made a crazy sort of sense why they would keep him alive but under such miserable conditions. Nathan&#8217;s survival became a matter of principle as well as of individual significance, which made the narrative doubly compelling.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already begun this series, now is the perfect time, since the third book will be out in late March and&#8211;better still&#8211;I&#8217;ll be reviewing it and the middle book, <em>Half Wild</em>, here on Geekly.

<p>Right? How cool was that? This trailer continues Game of Thrones&#8217; great traditional of having a wonderful, catchy song mixed with beautiful morsels like &#8220;I choose violence.&#8221; I did punch a Tim fist sized hole in my second monitor when my-main-man Davos dropped hot fire &#8220;I have never been much of a fighter. Apologies for what you are about to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know I am real hyped right now and my fervor for Season 6 has been awoken. How about you? What wonderful bits do you catch in the trailer? I have to go watch it 6 more times.</p>

<p><strong>Blindspot &#8211; Cease Forcing Enemy</strong><br />
<img class="alignright wp-image-36401 size-medium" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/02_NUP_171687_1380-300x200.jpg" alt="BLINDSPOT -- Episode 111 -- Pictured: (l-r) Sullivan Stapleton as Kurt Weller, Rob Brown as Reade, Jaimie Alexander as Jane Doe, Audrey Esparza as Zapata -- (Photo by: Giovanni Rufino/NBC)" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/02_NUP_171687_1380-300x200.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/02_NUP_171687_1380-298x199.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/02_NUP_171687_1380-620x413.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/02_NUP_171687_1380.jpg 759w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I have been looking forward to Blindspot&#8217;s return. The last episode before its break was the high point of the season. The story, while always intriguing, got much better with the reveal about the source of Jane&#8217;s tattoos. This episode furthered that explanation, even if it still withheld any actual information. Luckily, the show is entertaining enough that this continued problem isn&#8217;t a huge frustration. This episode delivered all the action and mystery that is the show&#8217;s true strength. Unfortunately, it also returned with a spotlight on its biggest problem. The team decodes a tattoo exactly when it has to. There is no rhyme or reason to this. As soon as a tattoo clue is deciphered, the event it refers to is happening at that exact moment. Yes, this is the element of suspension of disbelief that that show needs to be successful. With a show that is set in the &#8220;real world&#8221;, the aspect of the plot that is completely unbelievable has to fit into every major event. And it can be argued that the ultimate plan took the time of both decoding the tattoos and the events to which they refer into consideration. However, this is a part of the show that takes viewers out of the reality that the show is creating. But it&#8217;s a minor distraction and the show is good enough to compensate for it. I&#8217;m not too happy with the fetch quests that Jane will most likely be given as the season moves forward. The whole &#8220;you do for me and I&#8217;ll reveal the truth slowly&#8221; is frustrating. I would&#8217;ve rather not had this source of info and just waited for the team to figure things out. Another thing I didn&#8217;t like is the seeming inclusion of yet another government stooge to get in the team&#8217;s way. When the CIA element was removed last episode, I hoped that the team would have some free reign to really investigate the source of the tattoos. But now it seems that what is essentially Internal Affairs will be plaguing the team. However, it does make sense. The core mystery of Blindspot is all about government secrets and conspiracy. Even with these problems, I am very excited to see what happens next.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-36402 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NEJuliUCnb4oMO_2_b-300x158.jpg" alt="NEJuliUCnb4oMO_2_b" width="300" height="158" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NEJuliUCnb4oMO_2_b-300x158.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NEJuliUCnb4oMO_2_b.jpg 600w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NEJuliUCnb4oMO_2_b-298x157.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Gotham &#8211; Mr. Freeze</strong></span><br />
Once upon a time, <em>Gotham</em> was pitched as the realistic origins of the <em>Batman</em> universe. That was a total lie. The show is a ludicrous cartoon. The premise itself is bad enough and it pretty much negates a connection to any other Batman story in existence. The events of <em>Gotham</em> take things to another level. Characters act randomly with wildly changing motivation. Plots of the villains are complicated yet silly, and are based on the most ridiculous reasons. Foundational elements of the show are forgotten as soon as they are introduced. Within the scope of its own insanity, there is a sense of logic to the events of the show but that is not justification enough for the poor quality. Somehow, <em>Gotham</em> is popular. It&#8217;s mindless, stupid entertainment. I cannot fault people for having a different opinion, but <em>Gotham</em> is not a good show. This episode is a perfect example. After introductory exposition by Harvey Chipmunk Cheeks Dent, the show devolves into insanity. Butch has a drill hand. A drill hand. Hugo Strange is ripped exactly from the comic pages, and that look does not translate from paper to screen. Gordon is a murderer and liar. There&#8217;s a comedy routine at the pharmacy. Arkham is nothing but a torturous daycare that houses a secret facility that was really important back in season one and then immediately forgotten. Penguin throw a temper tantrum. Somehow, Fries&#8217; origin story retains most of the facts from the source material, but he&#8217;s a desperate killer instead of a sympathetic villain. This is the one part of Gotham that actually works like it&#8217;s supposed to. But he&#8217;s going into a super suit that looks more like an astronaut&#8217;s space suit next week, so just forget any potential there. <em>Gotham</em> is its own continuity and its own twisted version of the Batman story. In that sense, this was a fine episode. It effectively reintroduced all the main characters after a long break and advanced the story by revealing some details about the secret lab that has something to do with the villains. And it focused on Gordon&#8217;s internal struggle, which has become the main story of the show. That being said, I don&#8217;t like and will never enjoy this show. It&#8217;s a fever dream version of <em>Batman</em>. I can only imagine the horrors that the rest of this season will contain.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lucifer &#8211; Favorite Son<img class="size-full wp-image-36403 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/145669144260669-2.jpg" alt="145669144260669-2" width="299" height="199" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/145669144260669-2.jpg 299w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/145669144260669-2-298x198.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></strong></span><br />
If this show was nothing but Tom Ellis singing, I would be a much bigger fan. That was a fantastic scene. And the action that it was paired with was mildly entertaining. But then the show devolves into a bit of forced family drama and &#8220;character development&#8221; which was heavy-handed and pointless. But it did give opportunity for the one line that points to the only part of the story that has any connection to the typical Satan mythology. Speaking of which, this episode delivered a lot of that mythology. Possibly, this is an attempt to deepen the connection to the supernatural urban fantasy genre that this show is failing to be part of. Most of this came from the doctor who has a name now, but somehow didn&#8217;t know anything about the Satan mythology until it was spoon-fed to her. The reveal that she was simply playing along with Lucifer&#8217;s story but didn&#8217;t have any grounds for understanding his claims casts her in a somewhat incompetent light.  And this part of the episode furthers the &#8220;Satan as torturer/punisher/seeker of justice&#8221; story that this show is built upon. I don&#8217;t like this. It&#8217;s a fine plot. But this boils down to an alternate version of an established story. It&#8217;s distracting. If the story of the show was a little more solid, this wouldn&#8217;t matter so much. But it&#8217;s scattered and ill-defined. Lucifer&#8217;s wings as the magical McGuffin will possibly drive the rest of this season. This situation does give a slight glimmer of hope for a more interesting story. But judging by the evidence, this won&#8217;t be handled well. Unfortunately, everything else in this episode was typical <em>Lucifer</em> nonsense. The detective wavers from minute to minute in her opinion and perception of Lucifer. His &#8220;becoming mortal&#8221; problem is not defined and has no context. The core issue of <em>Lucifer&#8217;s</em> problem is that the show is an interesting concept, not a story. Sadly, the source material had a good story. I don&#8217;t know why the show is struggling so badly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-36404 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/LGN107A_0149b-630x533-300x254.jpg" alt="LGN107A_0149b-630x533" width="300" height="254" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/LGN107A_0149b-630x533-300x254.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/LGN107A_0149b-630x533-298x252.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/LGN107A_0149b-630x533-620x525.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/LGN107A_0149b-630x533.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Legends of Tomorrow &#8211; Marooned</strong></span><br />
Ah, the cliche &#8220;tortured hero watching an inexplicably poor quality hologram of his dead family&#8221; trope. It was bound to happen. I also think it&#8217;s hilarious that Rip has one single control on his captain&#8217;s chair. This points to the big problem with all super advanced future tech. The majority of control is in the hands of a computer and people just are just glorified mechanics who ask the AI to do things for them. And the show felt the need to point to what is possibly the prime perpetrator of this trope, Star Trek. But back to the episode. Why do all future AIs have a name that starts with &#8220;g&#8221;? And what&#8217;s the point of an AI with a fancy futuristic medical bay if the guy suffering cardiac arrest from suffocating has to have a dramatic moment of being brought back to life via punches? That, like so many parts of <em>Legends</em>, exists to be entertaining. From the pirates that exist only to get slaughtered to Hawkgirl being a rage monster, most of the events in <em>Legends</em> are just things that happen. I don&#8217;t dislike this. It&#8217;s like the big-budget effects-driven summer blockbuster movies. But is it a good strategy for an on-going television series? Probably not. Which is probably why the show decided to dedicate this episode to character development. Unfortunately, this development made for a pointless filler episode. Seeing Rip&#8217;s history had no positive impact on the plot. His drive and motivation had already been established. Watching it happen was simply not necessary. On the other hand, the showdown with Start and Rory was surprising and intense and should&#8217;ve had much more focus. If it truly ended the way it seems, this represents a huge shift in the tone of the show. I&#8217;m not against it happening. Rory as the constant source of team problems makes is boring and repetitive. But with the new info about Savage, possibly things can progress. But this part of the show also reminds viewers again that Rip is really bad at both time travel and his mission. He went rogue for all the right reasons (in his mind) but he doesn&#8217;t have a plan or any credible Intel. And with all the resources of time travel, why wouldn&#8217;t he simply go back to when Savage was first exposed to the meteor and stop it from happening? Of course, the simple answer is because of plot. Logic has to be suspended so that comic book plot can move forward. Which is exactly what <em>Legends</em> needs to do.</p>

<p>The Abridged Drunks and Dragons is our attempt to making getting into the DnD Podcast easier for new listeners. Episodes have been boiled down to around 10 &#8211; 20 minutes. All the important story bits, and even more important goofs and tangents have been left in for your enjoyment.</p>
<p>This original version of this episode is <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/drunks-and-dragons-episode-12-not-quite-through-the-woods/">Drunks and Dragons Episode 12</a>.</p>
<h5>Synopsis from the <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Drunks_and_Dragons_Episodes">Drunks and Dragons Wiki</a>:</h5>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Bolstered by their new abilities, <a title="Aludra the Dwarf" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Aludra_the_Dwarf">Aludra</a>, <a title="Tum &quot;Darkblade&quot; Thumble" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tum_%22Darkblade%22_Thumble">Tum</a>, <a title="Junpei Iori" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Junpei_Iori">Junpei</a> and <a title="Thom the Dragonborn" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Thom_the_Dragonborn">Thom</a> hastily arm themselves to face the sudden orc attack. As arrows begin to fly, Junpei accuses Thom of sleeping while on watch, making the group an easy target for their foes. Thom bristles at the slight to his honor and turns his anger on the <a title="Orc" href="http://geeklyinc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Orc">orcs</a>, launching a furious attack. It brings no aid to Junpei though, as he is struck down by the orc archers&#8230;</span></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At this point, everyone is probably sick of &#8220;Let It Go,&#8221; resultant jokes about letting &#8220;let it go&#8221; go, and anything to do with animated Norse princesses or their sentient snow sidekicks. Which is fine, because even though this is based on the same myth, &#8220;The Snow Queen,&#8221; it&#8217;s nothing like <em>Frozen</em>. Well, aside from the snow. And the Scandinavia. And the reindeer. And the main character does need to let some stuff go. And the young man is a jerk. And there is a journey to an ice castle.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-36321" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ravencoverfinal.jpg" alt="ravencoverfinal" width="358" height="537" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ravencoverfinal.jpg 533w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ravencoverfinal-200x300.jpg 200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ravencoverfinal-298x447.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" /></p>
<p>Okay, yes, I see your point. But it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s the grown-up&#8217;s <em>Frozen</em>. Yes, there are two women of roughly the same age who go on an adventure, but they&#8217;re not sisters. (They are <em>definitely</em> not sisters.) And neither of them is the Snow Queen. Gerta is, in point of fact, quite the opposite of the Snow Queen. She&#8217;s sturdy and a bit unsure of herself, but she&#8217;s filled with hope and love. The Queen, however, is a haughty, selfish spirit who only wants to crush that which she thinks is beneath her. And almost everything is beneath her as she flies about the world on her bone-white sleigh&#8211;everything but a few rare boys. Everything but Kay.</p>
<p>Kay has been Gerta&#8217;s not-so-secret crush since just about forever. They&#8217;re neighbors and playmates, or at least they can be when Kay is in a decent mood. But he can also be sullen and reticent, quite above it all. So when the Snow Queen arrives one blizzardy day, he goes to her. He takes her hand. And Gerta, who witnesses it all from her window, is paralyzed by the Snow Queen&#8217;s magic. This doesn&#8217;t deter her, however, from undertaking a great quest once the Queen has gone. She&#8217;s going to rescue Kay from the Queen&#8217;s clutches. She doesn&#8217;t know how, though, so it&#8217;s fortunate that she meets a wisecracking raven and a bandit girl and some plants (yes&#8211;plants&#8211;you&#8217;ll see) and a band of otters. And it&#8217;s fortunate that she will find a way to traverse the great Reindeer Roads, the mystic paths that will lead her to the heart of winter and the coldest heart in the world.</p>

<p>Everything T. Kingfisher writes is magnificent. It&#8217;s just so delightful and heartfelt and brilliant, with an emphasis on the brilliant. So often fairytale retellings feel forced, as if the author started with some kind of hook or twist that he thought was clever and then tried to cram an entire mythos into it and grind an entire story out of it. It&#8217;s like making sausage: maybe it tastes good, but you&#8217;re pretty suspicious about the whole endeavor.</p>
<p>Not so with <em>The Raven and the Reindeer.</em> Every time I read one of her books, it&#8217;s like settling in with a box of expensive chocolates. You can predict some of what you&#8217;re going to get (some wry humor, a kickass heroine, a helpful animal companion), but not all of it, but everything is certain to be smooth and scrumptious. I always end up devouring her books in a single day, since they&#8217;re fast paced and the prose is lovely without being flowery. And, in this case, the research into Finnish customs and Scandinavian living is excellent, and blended perfectly into the narrative without becoming pedantic. It&#8217;s just such an indulgent joy to be part of Kingfisher&#8217;s worlds. I want nothing more than for her to take on every single one of Hans Christen Anderson&#8217;s stories (and the Grimms&#8217;, while we&#8217;re at it) and remake them in her own style, so that I can go on indulging in them forever.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the Mat</span></em><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Original Air Date: 2/24/2016</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Castifer wisens up and is finally using his demons for something! (‘Cause really, what’s the point of having a demon horde if you aren’t going to delegate out some of the boring work?) </span></p>
<div id="attachment_36336" style="width: 738px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36336" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Organized-Hell.jpg" alt="Work, work, work." width="728" height="409" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Organized-Hell.jpg 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Organized-Hell-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Organized-Hell-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Organized-Hell-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Organized-Hell-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Organized-Hell-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Work, work, work.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He realizes that a Hand of God weapon is just what he’ll need to take on God’s apoplectic sister, and I guess time travel is off of the table now??? Anyway, he’s got minions looking through every ancient text for a possible artifact with God juice in it, while Crowley is cleaning the floor with his tongue.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36337" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36337" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Licking-the-floor.jpg" alt="Surprisingly, not the grossest place that his tongue has been." width="740" height="416" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Licking-the-floor.jpg 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Licking-the-floor-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Licking-the-floor-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Licking-the-floor-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Licking-the-floor-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Licking-the-floor-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Surprisingly, not the grossest place that his tongue has been.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if that weren’t humiliating enough, all of the demons gather around to watch, and most seem to enjoy the sight of their former boss on all fours “swabbin’ the deck.” However, Simmons, who manages to squirm her way into Castifer’s good graces, appears a little appalled, and it seems like Crowley might have one ally left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Hell is all a bustle looking for magical weapons, the Winchester brothers are getting burnt out pouring over their own books, but they don’t have the luxury of the supernatural creatures; they succumb to such bothersome things like fatigue and hunger. They decide on a little R&amp;R is in order, and they attend the wake of a professional wrestler that recently passed away. (Um, fun?) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone thinks that Larry “The Hangman” Lee took his nickname too seriously and killed himself using his own prop noose, but we know better! Something supernatural is amiss.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36338" style="width: 743px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36338" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wake-2.jpg" alt="Super inappropriate?" width="733" height="412" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wake-2.jpg 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wake-2-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wake-2-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wake-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wake-2-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wake-2-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Super inappropriate?</p></div>
<p>I gotta say, this whole scene is a little awkward to watch. It’s a wake; people are grieving, and yet Dean fanboys out when he meets one of his childhood heroes, Gunner Lawless. Oh, and then Sam tells the wrestling promoter/announcer, Rio, that he had a crush on her when he was a kid. Totally normal conversations to have with a stranger at a wake, right?</p>
<div id="attachment_36339" style="width: 779px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36339" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rio.jpg" alt="She’s no Sophia from Golden Girls..." width="769" height="432" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rio.jpg 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rio-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rio-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rio-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rio-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rio-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">She’s no Sophia from <em>Golden Girls</em>&#8230;</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the entertainment world, especially for smaller nomadic performance troupes, the show must always go on or else you lose money, and so they pay tribute to their deceased comrade by hosting a wrestling event that very same evening. Naturally, the Winchesters need to continue to pay their respects, and Dean is super pumped about it.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i.giphy.com/l2JJClrI4RQ5zuaju.gif" alt="" width="772" height="434" /></p>
<p>For as uncomfortable as I felt about the wake scene, the entire wrestling match is funny to watch and insightful—it’s one of the few fun excursions that John Winchester took his sons to and it is evident that the memories still mean a lot to the brothers. They had an unorthodox and dangerous childhood, but they cling to the good memories that they have, and let’s get real here, there’s nothing better then watching Dean act like a kid again.</p>
<div id="attachment_36340" style="width: 795px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36340" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hahaha.jpg" alt="You’re a grown man." width="785" height="442" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hahaha.jpg 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hahaha-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hahaha-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hahaha-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hahaha-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hahaha-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">You’re a grown man.</p></div>
<p>But Sam and Dean never seem to have a night out without something going terribly wrong and this is no exception. One of the spectators, who is double fisting beers, can’t wait in the bathroom line and decides to take a piss in the alley only to get killed by an unknown assailant. It might seem like a random murder except for the ritualistic carvings found on the body.</p>
<div id="attachment_36341" style="width: 788px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36341" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-phone.jpg" alt="He flashes a fake badge and they let him take a picture of a dead body with his phone." width="778" height="437" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-phone.jpg 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-phone-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-phone-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-phone-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-phone-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-phone-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">He flashes a fake badge and they let him take a picture of a dead body with his phone.</p></div>
<p>Sam decides to hit the books and research the strange markings found on the remains, but soon discovers that this isn’t the first time a body has shown up at one of the wrestling matches. In fact, every stop they’ve made on the circuit has someone ending up dead, and while most of the deaths appear to be accidents, all of them have the same peculiar carvings on the skin (suspicious, much?). The mark is an ancient Sumerian symbol that captures the soul. While Sam is doing his bookworm nerd shit (which I love him for. It’s what I’d be doing if I were a hunter) Dean hangs around the scene to question some of the wrestlers and staff and to do this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i.giphy.com/3ornjPxfRudvxJaNaM.gif" alt="" width="750" height="422" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can always count on Dean to end up at a bar—he starts buying all of the wrestlers shots that he’s spiked with holy water. (Not gonna lie, it’s a little creepy watching someone spike another person’s drink while they aren’t looking). In order to ensure that none of the wrestlers are demonic, he has to buy ALL of them shots splashed with some holy water which, of course, means Dean is doing that many shots as well.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36342" style="width: 815px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36342" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Been-there.jpg" alt="Been there…" width="805" height="453" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Been-there.jpg 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Been-there-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Been-there-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Been-there-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Been-there-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Been-there-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Been there…</p></div>

<p>There is only one wrestler that Dean wasn’t able to “roofie:” Shawn Harley. He’s a young upstart in the biz with something to prove, but when Sam and Dean arrive at his motel it’s obvious that a struggle took place, and Harley is nowhere to be found. The security footage shows Gunner as the kidnapper and a little piece of Dean’s heart breaks.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Crowley gets a break from licking floors, and gets a little help from Simmons. She says that there are demons that want Lucifer gone (and really, that’s got to be true. At least Crowley provides order and purpose to Hell. Crowley doesn’t just want demons around. He </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">needs</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them. Lucifer views them as disposable commodities—sure, they’re great to have around when he has use of them, but if he doesn’t then they’re just fun to terrorize and kill. Not what you’re looking for in a boss.) Crowley makes his escape with Simmons and is back in true form. They head to his secret stash where he just so happens to have a Hand of God artifact: the Rod of Aaron.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36344" style="width: 840px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36344" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Supernatural-books.jpg" alt="Are those Supernatural books? Crowley is a fanboy in his own right!" width="830" height="467" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Supernatural-books.jpg 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Supernatural-books-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Supernatural-books-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Supernatural-books-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Supernatural-books-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Supernatural-books-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Are those Supernatural books? Crowley is a fanboy in his own right!</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This would definitely give Crowley the upper hand, if only Simmons didn’t double-cross him. It’s a set up the whole time! Castifer knew that Crowley had been holding back information and sent Simmons to trick him into leading him to his storage unit. It doesn’t surprise me that Simmons did this—she’s a demon after all—but I’m surprised that Crowley fell for it. I don’t know if it’s hubris or stupidity, but he should always be assuming that everyone around him wants him dead. In fact, that should be his life motto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, but Crowley is a crafty bugger! He manages to get the rod out of the box before Castifer can grab it. Lucifer may have invented the double-cross, but Crowley perfected it. He gets juiced up on God power and tries to take out Castifer. Lucky for Castiel who’s still sharing the vessel with his brother, Simmons won’t let Lucifer die.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i.giphy.com/3ornjOFB0JbIvsUGrK.gif" alt="" width="844" height="475" /></p>
<p>Like all of the “touched by God” artifacts, the rod is a one hit wonder and now Crowley has to deal with a super pissed off Castifer. But again, the former King of Hell is a slippery one and he manages to disappear before the archangel hurts him too badly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But let me pause for a moment to acknowledge how amazing Misha Collins is doing at playing Lucifer. He’s really giving it his all. He went from the mostly deadpan Castiel to the man of a thousand expressions. Just look at him go!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-36349" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Castifer-group-1.png" alt="Castifer group" width="820" height="462" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Castifer-group-1.png 884w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Castifer-group-1-300x169.png 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Castifer-group-1-768x433.png 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Castifer-group-1-298x168.png 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Castifer-group-1-620x349.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truthfully, I wish this entire episode was about Crowley and Lucifer, but alas, there’s a missing wrestler that needs to be found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gunner sold his soul to a crossroad demon many years ago. The demon (Duke) decides not to collect on the contract as long as Gunner brings him fresh meat and Harley is the next one on the menu. The demon thinks that because Harley is young and arrogant he’ll jump at the chance for certain glory and eagerly hand over his soul. However, Harley turns out to be a better guy than I initially thought he was. He deduces that if there is a Hell than there must be a Heaven and he’d rather ensure his soul wound up at the pearly gates. Plus, that guy really believes in himself! He’s certain that he can win the glory that the demon promises on his own. For being kind of a dick, Harley turns out to be honorable, but he still winds up dead.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36346" style="width: 843px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36346" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dead-wrestlers.jpg" alt="So, with the mark on his chest...does that mean his soul went to Hell anyway?" width="833" height="469" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dead-wrestlers.jpg 1280w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dead-wrestlers-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dead-wrestlers-768x432.jpg 768w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dead-wrestlers-1200x675.jpg 1200w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dead-wrestlers-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dead-wrestlers-620x349.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 833px) 100vw, 833px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">So, with the mark on his chest&#8230;does that mean his soul went to Hell anyway?</p></div>
<p>Sam and Dean arrive on scene just in time to see that Gunner is the one who kills Harley. It’s pretty disappointing. Through the entire episode, Gunner seems, for the most part, like the grizzled and noble warrior of the group. He’s been around—he knows how things work and he’ll take the younger guys under his wing to show them the ropes. He’ll even keep guys in line when necessary. It’s tragic that in the end he’s willing to kill people for a few more years of mortal life (and a few more years outside of Hell).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean manages a “it’s never too late to do the right thing” speech that convinces Gunner to help him kill Duke. However, once the demon is dead, the hellhounds come to collect the old wrestler. He looks relieved, maybe even glad, to hear their howls.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_36347" style="width: 859px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36347" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Still-going-to-Hell.jpg" alt="You did the right thing, buddy.

<p>For the Winchester’s story line, this episode is a side quest without much meaning. Sure, watching Dean act silly and childlike is always fun, and Crowley “The Comeback Kid” making his escape from Castifer is entertaining, but I’m afraid this is an episode that I’ll likely forget. While the series takes a short break, we can at least look forward to the return of some beloved characters in upcoming episodes: Bobby, Rufus, and (according to one source) <a href="http://tvline.com/2016/02/16/supernatural-rob-benedict-returns-chuck-god-season-11/">Chuck</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supernatural returns March 23rd with <em>Safe House</em>.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Untwine</em> is the kind of book that must be read in installments. Not because it has Dickensian chapters; it actually flows so naturally from page to page, story to story, that it really <em>should</em> be read in one long afternoon. But at least for me, that was impossible. It was too heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Giselle and Isabelle are identical twin sisters, teenagers trying to forge both separate and united paths through high school and the rest of life. Giz is an artist and Iz a classical musician, a flautist. They move in different circles, have different crushes and different heroes, but are still each other&#8217;s best friends. They have the same fierce sense of justice, the same love for cathedrals and their native Haiti, and they even share the same dreams.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-36318" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/22616123.jpg" alt="22616123" width="313" height="475" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/22616123.jpg 313w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/22616123-198x300.jpg 198w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/22616123-298x452.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /></p>
<p>In an instant, those dreams are in tatters. The car accident leaves Giselle&#8211;or maybe, just maybe, it&#8217;s Isabelle?&#8211;in a waking coma like a lucid dream, able to see and hear some of what&#8217;s happened but unable to communicate. She sees her parents, who before the accident were preparing to formally separate, both together and apart. She sees her aunt, her uncle, her grandparents&#8230;but where is her sister? Then come the police, bringing dark hints that it wasn&#8217;t an accident. But what can Giz do when she&#8217;s barely able to move? When she doesn&#8217;t even know how to grieve or cope with a world without Iz?</p>
<p>Who could possibly bear this much sorrow?</p>
<p>Edwidge Danticat could. She sounds like the magnificent headmaster of a Hogwarts rival school, and she should be. She is a wizard, and she casts the most devastating spells. It&#8217;s not just bedside weeping&#8211;this isn&#8217;t some <em>Walk to Remember</em> or even <em>If I Stay </em>(I&#8217;m not equating those two, by the way; only one is garbage)&#8211;it&#8217;s the small and dramatic motions of grief and coping: of standing up, of taking first steps, of saying first words. And then the next steps, the next words, making a story from and in spite of another story&#8217;s end. Into two girls’ lives she weaves notes of the Haitian-American community and language, Haitian history, meditations on relationships (both teen and adult), religion, social justice—you name it and this book has it, but so integrally you could never mistake it for anything but Isabelle’s and Giselle’s story. It’s a marvelous, magical brew.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly brave to write a book like this. Going so deep into the love and grief of another human being&#8211;even a fictional one&#8211;is no easy task, and Danticat does it with such unspeakable tenderness. It&#8217;s one of the most intimate and truthful portrayals of grief that I&#8217;ve seen, encompassing the absurdity and kindness and violence and emptiness and a hundred other things about it. I had to pause in reading not just to cry, but to copy down passages that were just so real, and really just so beautiful.</p>
<p>Reading this book was like being in orbit around it. It was impossible to get too close all at once, but impossible to escape. It&#8217;s a warm and wonderful star, and I am very grateful to Danticat for writing it.</p>

<p>Raw Fury Games, the folks that brought you <a href="http://geeklyinc.com/geekly-game-lab-kingdom-complete-playthrough/">Kingdom</a>, has announced that they are publishing their third game, GoNNER. It is a 2D platformer that is procedurally-generated, has roguelike elements, and looks beautiful. GoNNER is being developed by Art in Heart, which was founded by programmer, game designer, and artist <a href="https://twitter.com/dittomat">Ditto</a>.</p>
<div class="video"><iframe width="620" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VA3saHRW3H8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>We only know a little bit about GoNNER so far, but our first impression has us wanting more. The art style is a great combination of beautiful, creepy, and cute.  The game play is advertised as &#8220;tough as hell&#8221;, and the video supports that claim. If you are down for an adorable and challenging roguelike, keep an eye on this one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This is the last week before Gotham (booooooo) and Blindspot (yaaaaaaaaay) return. I&#8217;m terrified and excited. </em></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Supernatural &#8211; Beyond the Mat<img class="size-medium wp-image-36298 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/supernaturalbeyondthemat-300x185.jpg" alt="supernaturalbeyondthemat" width="300" height="185" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/supernaturalbeyondthemat-300x185.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/supernaturalbeyondthemat-298x183.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/supernaturalbeyondthemat-620x382.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/supernaturalbeyondthemat.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
This episode felt like it should&#8217;ve happened much earlier in the season. It was a typical monster of the week, but it divided its time between Sam and Dean stumbling across a demon and Lucifer/Castiel facing off with Crowley. I like the bits with the demons more than the bits with the Winchesters, even if the events were completely predictable. Sam and Dean found a crossroads demon screwing around with a group of traveling wrestlers. The punchy ballet was entertaining, if even more fake than normal. It was great seeing Dean get to be a fanboy and it&#8217;s been a long time since he got to have a goofball montage. Ultimately, the demon was killed (remember when that used to be difficult?) and the boys learned a lesson about sticking to their job during the hard times. The motivational speech at the end is what makes me think this episode should&#8217;ve be placed earlier than third to last in this season. It was very much a &#8220;when the going gets tough&#8230;&#8221; speech, and that usually happens about mid-season when the boys are just realizing how incredibly screwed they are. But the pacing for this entire season has been out of whack. I am disappointed that the Hand of God items keep showing up and getting wasted immediately. However, if this was an earlier season, that would&#8217;ve been going on since the premier episode. The Hands of God feel like a McGuffin fetch quest that got added into this season&#8217;s story far too late. Luckily, they seem to just activate for anyone, so there probably won&#8217;t be any &#8220;how do we use this&#8221; scenes (not that there&#8217;s time for it) or &#8220;someone has to die to activate the power&#8221; scenes (hopefully). The best part of this episode was Crowley being Crowley again. The second best part was lost when Sam pointed it out. Had it been left to viewers to see the comparison between the wrestlers and the Winchesters, it would&#8217;ve had much more impact. Instead, Sam had to go and point it out, the big lovable dummy. The worst part of the episode was Dean picking an electronic key card lock with mechanical lock pics. With only two episodes left in the season, the pace needs to pick up. I&#8217;m starting it worry that this plot line will not be resolved and stretch on into next season, which is a bad idea.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-36299 alignleft" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/izombie-2.14-300x168.jpg" alt="izombie 2.14" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/izombie-2.14-300x168.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/izombie-2.14-298x167.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/izombie-2.14.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />iZombie &#8211; Eternal Sunshine of the Caffeinated Mind</strong></span><br />
As usual, I equate the quality of an episode with the quality of the cooking montage. Brain scones were clever, so this was a good episode. And there were coffee shop montage, which are near and dear to my heart. It featured the gorgeous Anders singling gorgeously. And while his character came out of no-where, seeing Enrico Colantoni was a joy. A lot happened this episode, but it was all handled properly. The pacing was not rushed and nothing was overly confusing. The crime of the week had nothing to do with the main plot, but it delivered a conclusion with a huge impact (put not intended) that was lost due to the genre shenanigans of the show. If this was a non-zombie-focused crime procedural drama, the main characters would&#8217;ve spent time raging over the escape of a manipulative killer while debating the philosophy of choice and consequence. This type of crime feels weird for <em>iZombie</em>. Crimes of the week are usually wrapped up nicely, and don&#8217;t deal with deeper issues like this. It was a welcome change, but it was out of place when compared to the show&#8217;s typical format. When it comes to the main plot, revealing Drake&#8217;s true motivation helps a great deal. It provides some context for what&#8217;s happening. Blaine&#8217;s big surprise was truly shocking. The first part, not the second. And I absolutely loved the out of focus climb from the dirt scene at the end. The confrontation between Liv and Rita/Gilda will certainly have some more negative consequences. I wonder if Major did it on purpose. His plot line is full of double crosses, so maybe he&#8217;s trying to get her out of the way for his eventual show down with Du Clark. There are five episodes left this season. I&#8217;m hoping that all of the next few episodes will be as plot-heavy as this one. I&#8217;d really enjoy better pacing and development as the season wraps up.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lucifer &#8211; Sweet Kicks<img class="size-medium wp-image-36300 alignright" src="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/p7golnzigl0h5s4khc7k-300x169.jpg" alt="p7golnzigl0h5s4khc7k" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/p7golnzigl0h5s4khc7k-300x169.jpg 300w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/p7golnzigl0h5s4khc7k-298x168.jpg 298w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/p7golnzigl0h5s4khc7k-620x349.jpg 620w, http://geeklyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/p7golnzigl0h5s4khc7k.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></span><br />
Hey, Lucifer didn&#8217;t say the show title this week. But he did continue to state that he hates liars. The show sticks to what it has established, but that established story is poorly written. Making Satan out to be the champion of punishing the guilty and obsessed with Justice flies in contradiction to the established Christian mythology. Sure, it works for the show, but it&#8217;s lazy. Instead of working with an idea and creatively solving the problems of the material it is based on, the writers just change everything. Yes, this is the nature of all almost all creative projects. But when working with such an established concept that is ingrained in the understanding of almost everyone, certain guidelines should be followed. What tops the list of things that bother me about this show is that there is no defined plot. Lucifer is skipping around snarking at things and trying to figure out if and why he&#8217;s changing. His angel buddies are trying to get him back to Hell. These are elements of a plot, not an entire plot. But there is nothing else happening in the show. And what&#8217;s happening with Lucifer doesn&#8217;t make sense. It seems that only Decker can hurt him, but he&#8217;s playing it like he is mortal. However, nothing in the show happens that&#8217;s a real risk. The show tries to justify his shenanigans with the police, but then continues to throw unexplainable events at them to just be accepted and washed away. <em>Lucifer</em> is a lazy, sloppy show. It started with an intriguing concept, but does not have the ability to support itself.</p>

This episode starts with a flurry of blows to the viewer. The emotional drama of Felicity struggling to recover is followed by a sucker punch of Darhk snarking his way out of the shadows in perfect over the top villain form. Then there&#8217;s the conflict of Felicity learning about William, which is then topped by yet another person learning about Oliver&#8217;s secret. Constantine is in Hell (literally) and then Vixen shows up. Not only does the show deliver a great version of Vixen with spot-on effects to support her powers, but it&#8217;s the same actress that voices the character for the CW animated show (which is nodded to in a lovely pun). Oof. Wow. What a way to start the episode. But as much as I love Darhk, he falls prey to the problem of every villain in that he doesn&#8217;t recognize his nemesis in a mask. I hope that he&#8217;s just toying with Oliver. Overall, this was a good episode. It moved the plot forward while introducing a new character to the DC TV universe. Sadly, the choreography in this episode pales in comparison to the perfect action and film work in last week&#8217;s episode. My favorite part of this episode was, unsurprisingly, Merlyn. He always does the wrong thing, but he does it for what he sees as the right reason. Such complete conviction and dedication is unparalleled in other media. My least favorite part of the episode was the ending. Not Felicity&#8217;s decision (even though that was heart-breaking and extremely selfish of her) but in how her recovery was depicted. This show is not about immediate payoffs, and that&#8217;s what happened. It was done to highlight the drama of the moment. But it was the wrong choice for her character arc. What I do like is that this moment continues to support Arrow&#8217;s focus on consequences. Everything in this show is about choices and their cost. That is what makes it consistently the best.</p>

This was a heavy drama episode. But it featured Digg, so that helped offset a lot of the boring parts. In general, the overall attitude of this episode was weird. The primary plot of this season is seemingly resolved, so what&#8217;s really happening? And there&#8217;s an even bigger question with the reveal of who&#8217;s underneath the Zoom mask. There&#8217;s still no truth behind the shock, but one of those crazy theories on the Internet is sure to be true. Really, the last few seconds of this episode were all that interested me. Fighting King Shark was cool, but he did not feel like a threatening bad guy. The heavy-handed drama between every character was frustrating in that it slowed the pace of the episode and the season to a grinding halt. I liked that Barry admitted that everything that has gone wrong recently has been basically his fault. But there&#8217;s no consequence. <em>Flash</em> is about the drama of realization, not the impact of the consequence. Wally is an annoying addition to the cast right now. If he doesn&#8217;t become a speedster soon, all of his references to speed will get frustratingly stupid. I like <em>Flash</em> best when there are big super heroes action scenes, science terms are being tossed around like candy, and the supporting stars step into the spotlight with snappy dialogue. The last two elements were featured in this episode and done very well. There are quite a few episodes left in this season. I am looking forward to a return to the action that makes <em>Flash</em> so good.</p>

Old Man Oliver was very entertaining, even if he hasn&#8217;t changed his grumpy ways in 30 years. This was definitely a filler episode that served no purpose other than fun fan service. And it was great! The trend continues of Sara and Snart being the best characters and the only ones that act as the team&#8217;s moral compass. Even though this episode had nothing to do with the main plot of stopping Savage, I can&#8217;t fault the show for this delay in the action. Legends is a show where the main characters show up in random places and react to things. This show delivers classic, goofy, often times pointless comic book action. One-off episodes like this are par for the course. Plus, the plot of this season is pretty thin. Good guys chase the bad guy. Either they catch him and the show&#8217;s over or they don&#8217;t catch him and the plot gets dragged on into season two. The show can&#8217;t move too quickly towards Savage and the eventual show down. Episodes like this one that slow the pace of the main plot are necessary. Overall, this was a good episode. It let every character get a chance in the spotlight and it played to the strengths that have been established so far. But I can&#8217;t help but think about what&#8217;s coming next. Will the ultimate showdown between the Legends and Savage simply be an epic brawl? It would be entertaining. And the show has proven that it can handle big effects-driven fight scenes effectively. However, I am hoping for something even grander. With time travel and the multiverse existing wishing this TV continuity, maybe the final battle will feature different versions of the Legends (and maybe even other CW DC heroes). It would be very easy for Rip to say that there&#8217;s no chance of beating Savage and Ray to reply with some science mumbo jumbo about pulling their duplicates from the time stream. It probably won&#8217;t happen. But it would be cool, right?</p>
